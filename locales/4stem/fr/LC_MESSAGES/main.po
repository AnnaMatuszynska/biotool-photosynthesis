msgstr "You need to know one more aspect of PAM, the saturating pulses. Our machine gives the plant a very intense light \
        pulse every few seconds, overloading its photosynthetic machinery. In this state, the measuring light is fully \
        converted into fluorescence, and we measure the maximal fluorescence yield 'Fm'. While the standard fluorescence \
        yield depends on the plant's photosynthesis, the Fm does not. So by comparing normal and maximal yield, we can \
        tell apart changes in and outside of photosynthesis, for example, the plant's light protection. When you then \
        also apply protocols of differently colored lights, you can calculate the previously mentioned ΦPSII, NPQ, and \
        many other values. But how that is done goes much too far. Most important is that you understand that we compare \
        what fraction of light is currently turned to fluorescence, how much at maximum, and how these measurements change \
        over time and conditions."

msgstr "We hope you had a comprehensive introduction to the fascinating world of plant biology on this website. By \
        analyzing diagrams created with computer models, you were able to learn about the effects of light intensity \
        on photosynthesis and explore the topic of plant short-term memory. In doing so, you should have drawn the \
        following conclusions:"

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_1"
msgstr "- Light intensity has a significant effect on the rate of photosynthesis in plants. As light intensity \
        increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases to some degree."

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_2"
msgstr "- The relationship between light intensity and photosynthetic rate is not linear. Rather, it follows a curve \
        that peaks at a certain point, the saturation point."

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_3"
msgstr "- Plants have the ability to remember past light exposure and adjust their photosynthetic rates accordingly. \
        This short-term memory allows plants to optimize their energy consumption and adapt to changing environmental conditions."

msgid "EXPLANATION_MEASUREMENT_2"
msgstr "This patterning is essential because we want to measure photosynthesis under natural conditions, outside and in \
        different irradiation when the plant already fluoresces. Typically, we would not be able to tell apart the \
        fluorescence produced by the outside and the measuring light. But, because our measuring light and its resulting \
        fluorescence are -modulated-, with some clever math, we can calculate how much fluorescence was caused by just \
        our measuring light. And because all the flashes were the same, we measured the fraction of light turned to \
        fluorescence - a fluorescence yield. This yield is what you will see in the model graphs. It decreases when the \
        plant's photosynthesis is more efficient, with more powerful light protection, and many more factors also affect \
        it. And it is comparable regardless of the outside light - a versatile measurement."
