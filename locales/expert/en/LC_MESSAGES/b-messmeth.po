msgid "INTRODUCTION_MEASUREMENT"
msgstr "The previous page told you about the importance of photosynthesis, its processes, and how it relates to \
        modelling. Because biologists like numbers and measuring things, so they came up with many photosynthesis \
        measurements. Very commonly, for example, they follow oxygen production or the parallel take up of carbon \
        dioxide. However, metering gasses can be tricky, especially if you want to do it outside on a field or tree. \
        Here is where a speciality of plants comes into play: They can glow!"

#: pages/1 Messmethode.py:32
msgid "PLANT_ARE_SHINING_RED"
msgstr "When light shines on them, they not only photosynthesise but also release a small fraction of that absorbed \
        light. Something similar happens, for example, when your white T-shirt glows purple in disco-black light. \
        Plants, on the other hand, release red light. Now you might think: "But plants are green, and I have never seen \
        one glow!". And you would be, of course, right. The light plants don't absorb and instead reflect is green, \
        which we see as their primary colour. The red glow, which we call 'fluorescence', is much fainter than that, \
        and with light coming into our eyes from all other directions, we simply cannot see it. We, therefore, prepared \
        a small experiment for you: Here, we covered a small portion of a plant's leaf with a sticker and will now shine \
        a strong light on it. The red filter helps us ignore distracting light and focus on the red glow. Now watch what \
        happens:"

#: pages/1 Messmethode.py:32
msgid "EXPLANATION_VIDEO"
msgstr "Did you see the red glow and the sticker's ghostly imprint on the leaf? You just saw the plant's adaptation in \
        action. Because the plant cannot move, it must adjust to its surroundings. A lot of light arrived at the leaf's \
        parts not covered by the sticker. So much, in fact, that the plant decided to produce some chemicals acting as \
        a kind of sunscreen within the cells. After a few seconds, these protected cells received less light and \
        'fluoresced' less. Now, when we lifted the sticker, suddenly, the cells which did not produce any sunscreen \
        saw the intense light and fluoresced at full force - right next to their protected neighbours. This sharp \
        difference in fluorescence you saw as the stickers after-image. And as we continued shining the lamp, all cells \
        began to adapt to it, which vanished the picture on the leaf."

            photochemical quenching must first be excluded. For this purpose, the plant is irradiated with pulses of light \
            with strong intensity. The measured fluorescence can be attributed to NPQ if, at the \
            starting point the plant was dark-adapted. The change in fluorescence during light or \
            dark adaptations can be measured."
