msgstr "We hope you had a comprehensive introduction to the fascinating world of plant biology on this website. By \
        analyzing diagrams created with computer models, you were able to learn about the effects of light intensity \
        on photosynthesis and explore the topic of plant short-term memory. In doing so, you should have drawn the \
        following conclusions:"

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_1"
msgstr "- Light intensity has a significant effect on the rate of photosynthesis in plants. As light intensity \
        increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases to some degree."

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_2"

        that peaks at a certain point, the saturation point."

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_3"

On this page you will learn how can we measure the dynamics of photosynthesis in real time using light (precisely fluorescence) measuring devices. As biology is continously becoming a more quantitative science, obviously numerous methods to probe photosynthesis exist. For example, as plants produce oxygen and take up carbon dioxide, photosynthesis can be measured by how fast these gasses are produced or consumed. However, metering gasses can be tricky, especially if you want to do it outside on a tree or in a field. Therefore a particularly important characteristic of photosynthetic organisms is essential in providing alternative methods of measuring photosynthesis *in vivo*!"

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "INTRODUCTION_GLOWING"
msgstr "Here is where a specialty of plants comes into play: They can re-emit light and in proper conditions shine! When light shines on leaves, they use majority of the light to run complex photochemical reactions of photosynthesis, but a small part of the absorbed light is reemitted. Something similar happens when your white \
        T-shirt shines purple in a disco's black light. When something shine in a different light color when illuminated, \
        this is called 'fluorescence'. And the plant's fluorescence shine is red."

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "PLANT_ARE_SHINING_RED"
msgstr "Now you might think: 'But plants are green, and I have never seen one fluoresce!'. And, of course, this is right. \
        Plants don't absorb green light and instead reflect it, which we see as their primary color. Their red shine, \
        however, is much fainter than that, and with stronger light coming into our eyes from all directions, we just can't see it."

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "INTRODUCTION_EXPERIMENT"
msgstr "We, therefore, prepared a small experiment for you: Here, we covered a small portion of a plant's leaf with a \
        sticker with the RWTH letters and will now shine a strong light on it. The camera's red filter helps us ignore \
        distracting light and focus on the red fluorescence. Now watch what happens:"


#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "EXPLANATION_VIDEO"
msgstr "Did you see the red shine and the sticker's ghostly imprint on the leaf? You just saw the plant's adaptation in \
        action. Because the plant cannot move, it must adjust to its surroundings. A lot of light arrived at the leaf's \
        parts not covered by the sticker. Because that light could be harmful, the plant quickly produced some chemicals \
        acting as a kind of sunscreen within the cells. After a few seconds, these cells were protected and received less \
        light and fluoresced less. But, when we lifted the sticker, the cells below had not produced sunscreen. They saw \
        the intense light and fluoresced at full force - right next to their protected neighbors. This sharp difference \
        in fluorescence you saw as the stickers after-image. And as we continued shining the lamp, all cells adapted to \
        it, vanishing the picture on the leaf."

msgid "EXPLANATION_MEASUREMENT_1"
msgstr "This experiment showed you the shine of plants and how amazingly they can adjust to the light. But how can this \
        help with testing photosynthesis? A lot, actually. Because not only the 'sunscreen' affects leaf fluorescence, \
        but many other factors do, too. If you are interested in how this happens, look into the :blue[Advanced] section. Let's \
        say for now how strongly the plant photosynthesizes also has an effect on the strength of the reemitted light signal."


#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "INTRODUCTION_PHI"
msgstr "So scientists invented a way to measure this fluorescence and track how it changes over time (you \
        will hear about this 'PAM' later). With some clever maths behind it, they can then calculate a lot of the things \
        we might be interested in: How healthy the leaf is, how much it protects itself from the light, and, most \
        importantly, how it is doing photosynthesis. We name this last measurement 'ΦPSII', with the greek letter 'Psi', \
        and you might see it along some of the graphs you will produce later. The higher it is, the better, as the plant \
        is doing photosynthesis more efficiently."

msgid   "SATURATING_PULSES"
msgstr  "Saturating Pulses of light"

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "EXPLANATION_ATTEMPTS"
msgstr "You need to know one more aspect of PAM, the saturating pulses. Our machine gives the plant a very intense light \
        pulse every few seconds, overloading its photosynthetic machinery. In this state, the measuring light is fully \
        converted into fluorescence, and we measure the maximal fluorescence yield 'Fm'. While the standard fluorescence \
        yield depends on the plant's photosynthesis, the Fm does not. So by comparing normal and maximal yield, we can \
        tell apart changes in and outside of photosynthesis, for example, the plant's light protection. When you then \
        also apply protocols of differently colored lights, you can calculate the previously mentioned ϕPSII, NPQ, and \
        many other values. But how that is done goes much too far. Most important is that you understand that we compare \
        what fraction of light is currently turned to fluorescence, how much at maximum, and how these measurements change \
        over time and conditions."

In the bottom panel you see results of the PAM experiments. Take a good look, cause in few minutes you will be producing similar results but not with a help of a fluorometer but your computer! So what do we see in this graph? It is a result of a special light protocol, where a dark-adapted plant is exposed to very weak, actinic light (AL, white area shown in the light bar, L) followed by dark recovery, where the light is switched off completely (black area in L). Multiple saturating light flashes (saturation pulses, SP) are applied before, during and after the actinic illumination to measure the maximal fluorescence Fm, Fm', Fm'', respectively. So why do we exactly see any effect? This is explained with the upper left scheme. Light energy absorption brings chlorophyll molecules to the first excited state (S1, see the simplified Jablonsky diagram in the upper panel on the left). For chlorophylls to return to the ground state (S0), the absorbed energy can be used for charge separation and photosynthesis (photochemical quenching, qP), dissipated as heat (non-photochemical quenching, NPQ), or re-emitted as fluorescence. And now, the most important part: the fluorescence emission spectra are red-shifted from the absorption spectra (upper panel on the right). This basically means that the fluorescence can be detected using fluorometers with corresponding optical filters and their signal will not be mistaken with the light that we actually shine on the plants. The emitted fluorescence signal is recorded, as shown in the lower panel with key readouts. It took us a long time to summarize everything on one figure only and this figure originates from our previous work (Nies et al. 2021)."

This disease has surprised the people of Planet-X so that they separated their population into three categories, the ones that are susceptible to the disease and can get sick at any moment (S), the ones that recovered from the infection (R), and the currently infected ones (I). To model the transition between each category, we determine the rate of infection (v1) dependent on the number of S and I in the total population (N) and their rate of recovery (v2) solely reliant on the I (Equation 2). They also discovered that the R gain complete immunity, but the people are too stressed to grow their population. To know how their population will look in a few months, they try a new method they heard from Earth about, namely **mathematical modeling**. To start, you should create a scheme for your problem; in this case, the S will become I at a rate of v1, and the I will become R at a rate of v2."

A handy mathematical tool to depict the change of something depending on the change of another specific value is the so-called Ordinary Differential Equation&nbsp;(ODE). If you have never seen what an ODE looks like, click the box Ordinary Differential Equations. Using differential equations, you can describe the relationship between the time and change in the number of people in each category, so overall, three equations. This set of three equations is called a system of ODEs and will be solved numerically using an integrator. So let's apply this method to our example of Planet-X, first by creating the ODE system:"

Let's apply this method to the disease on Planet-X. According to the scientists, the infection rate is (β&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), and the recovery rate is (γ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.2).

        changed temperatures (heat and cold), flooding events, and drought can lead to stressful events in plants. Those \
        factors can have various short- and long-term effects on plants– summarized in Fig. right. Nevertheless, plants \
        experience stress upon sudden changes but have a *highly flexible metabolism* for adaptation. *One of the first \
        reactions in plant metabolism is photosynthesis*, which **delivers energy** to sustain plant life. Photosynthesis \
        itself is directly and indirectly affected by changed environmental conditions. Therefore, the analysis of \
        photosynthesis and the fixation of CO₂ by plants is an important measure of overall **plant fitness**, **productivity**, \
        and **survival**. Consequently, basic research on photosynthesis and its efficiency is essential to assess our changing world."
