msgstr "Dear students, on this website you will have the opportunity to deal with the topic of photosynthesis. In \
        addition, you will deal with the effect of different light intensities on this. The goal is not only to gain \
        knowledge, but also to improve your skills in analyzing diagrams."

msgid "PROCESS"
msgstr "To do this, you will first learn the measurement method with which we can estimate the photosynthetic \
        efficiency. Afterwards, you can perform digital experiments with plants to find out how different light \
        intensities affect the plants."

        that can produce biomass are called **producers**. These include, in particular, plants. These can produce \

        purpose, plants have, on the one hand, roots that can absorb water and nutrients from the soil. On the other \
        hand, plants have stomata in their leaves, through which plants can absorb CO₂ from the air."

msgid "EXPANDER_PHOTOSYNTHESIS_EXPLANATION_1"
msgstr "Just like humans, plants need nutrients for their growth. The most essential of these are water and minerals, \
        but plants also need fats, carbohydrates and proteins. Most of these nutrients plants can absorb from the soil \
        through their roots, but not all of them. As already mentioned, plants are producers and can therefore \
        manufacture nutrients. These nutrients include, in particular, carbohydrates, which are produced during photosynthesis."

msgid "EXPANDER_PHOTOSYNTHESIS_EXPLANATION_2"
msgstr "In photosynthesis, plants produce biomass in the form of glucose. To do this, they need CO₂, H₂O and energy in \

        about the process of photosynthesis."

msgid "EXPANDER_PHOTOSYNTHESIS_LOCATION_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "Photosynthesis takes place in the cells of the mostly green components of plants. In these cells are \
        specialized organelles the chloroplasts. There, the part of photosynthesis takes place, which \
        is called the light reaction. The so-called photosystems are located in the membrane. Photosystem II (PSII), \
        which uses the energy of light to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, is of particular interest to us. "

msgstr "What actually happens when too much light and thus excess energy hits the Photosystem II? Does it break down \
        and then have to be renewed by the cell? Fortunately not! Instead, the excess energy can be released in the \
        form of heat or used for ATP synthesis. In this way, the cell can be protected. The two non-photochemical \
        protective mechanisms are referred to as NPQ."

        research and industry. In particular, whenever problems need to be solved that would be too costly to solve using \
        standard test procedures would cause too high costs. The problem is described mathematically and \
        Then the mathematical problem is solved with mathematical methods. The result must then be applied to \
        the real situation, i.e. the problem, and the solution can then be evaluated. If the solution \
        is not sufficient, the mathematical problem must be revised. The eventual successful mathematical \
        description of the problem is called a mathematical model."
