On this page, you will learn how we can measure the dynamics of photosynthesis in real time using light (precisely fluorescence) measuring devices. As biology is continuously becoming a more quantitative science, numerous methods to probe photosynthesis exist. For example, as plants produce oxygen and take up carbon dioxide, photosynthesis can be measured by how fast these gasses are produced or consumed. However, metering gasses can be tricky, especially if you want to do it outside on a tree or field. Therefore, a significant characteristic of photosynthetic organisms is essential in providing alternative methods of measuring photosynthesis *in vivo*!"

Something similar happens when your white T-shirt shines purple in a disco's black light. When something shines in a different light color when illuminated, this is called 'fluorescence'.

A lot of light arrived at the leaf's parts not covered by the sticker. Because that light could be harmful, the plant quickly produced some chemicals acting as 'sunscreen' within the cells. After a few seconds, these cells were protected and received less light and fluoresced less. But, when we lifted the sticker, the cells below had not produced sunscreen. They saw the intense light and fluoresced at full force - right next to their protected neighbors. This sharp difference in fluorescence you saw as the stickers after-image. And as we continued shining the lamp, all cells adapted to it, vanishing the picture on the leaf."

Take a good look because, in a few minutes, you will produce similar results not with the help of a fluorometer but with your computer! So, what do we see in this graph? It results from a unique light protocol, where a dark-adapted plant is exposed to very weak actinic light (AL, white area shown in the light bar, L), followed by dark recovery, where the light is switched off completely (black area in L). Multiple saturating light flashes (saturation pulses, SP) are applied before, during, and after the actinic illumination to measure the maximal fluorescence Fm, Fm', Fm'', respectively. We can use these fluorescence features to calculate the values quantifying photosynthesis, e.g., the amount of NPQ. So why do we exactly see any effect? This is explained with the upper left scheme. Light energy absorption brings chlorophyll molecules to the first excited state (S1, see the simplified Jablonsky diagram in the upper panel on the left). For chlorophylls to return to the ground state (S0), the absorbed energy can be used for charge separation and photosynthesis (photochemical quenching, qP), dissipated as heat (non-photochemical quenching, NPQ), or re-emitted as fluorescence. And now, the most crucial part: the fluorescence emission spectra are red-shifted from the absorption spectra (upper panel on the right). This means that the fluorescence can be detected using fluorometers with corresponding optical filters, and their signal will not be mistaken for the light that we shine on the plants. The emitted fluorescence signal is recorded with key readouts, as shown in the lower panel. It took us a long time to summarize everything on one figure only, and this figure originates from our previous work (Nies et al. 2021)."

While the standard fluorescence yield depends on the plant's photosynthesis, the Fm does not. So by comparing normal and maximal yield, we can tell apart changes in and outside photosynthesis, for example, the plant's light protection. When you also apply protocols of differently colored lights, you can calculate the previously mentioned ΦPSII, NPQ, and many other values. But how that is done goes much too far. Most important is that you understand that we compare what fraction of light is currently turned to fluorescence, how much at maximum, and how these measurements change over time and conditions."

Using differential equations, you can describe the relationship between the time and the change in the number of people in each category, so overall, there are three equations.

msgstr "The FvCB model is a purely mathematical tool used to depict photosynthesis in C<sub>3</sub> plants by calculating their carbon assimilation (A). It was first created in 1980 by Graham Farquhar, Susanne von Caemmerer, and Joseph Berry and has since undergone many different variations and updates. The most basic version uses four equations, each depicting the A with a specific limiting rate. These include the RuBisCO limited rate (Ac), the electron transport limited rate (Aj), and the triphosphate limited rate (Ap), where the minimum of the three is taken as the end-resulting A. These equations include several different parameters that can be measured or estimated beforehand. This step is crucial as it gives life to the model, and by varying these, you alter the model's results."

#: pages/model_explain.py:87
msgid "FVCB_2"
msgstr "These rates use an epitome of parameters that have to be measured or determined beforehand. The model uses the chloroplast CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure (C<sub>c</sub>), the chloroplast O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure (O), the C<sub>c</sub> where A = −R<sub>d</sub> (Γ<sub>&midast;</sub>), the maximal rate of carboxylation (V<sub>cmax</sub>), the Michaelis-Menten constants of carboxylation and oxygenation (K<sub>c</sub> and K<sub>o</sub> respectively), the potential electron transport rate (J) and the rate of inorganic phosphate supply to the chloroplast (T<sub>p</sub>) to calculate the three rates. The day respiration (R<sub>d</sub>) is subtracted to portray the respective assimilation rates. It is to be noted that this model is limited to a C<sub>c</sub> that is larger than Γ<sub>&midast;</sub>. \n"
"\n This model is widely popular among scientists, as it is relatively simple and uses no complicated mathematical methods like integrations. As you may have guessed, this model type differs from the SIR model we explained earlier. It doesn’t use any ODEs and, therefore, cannot show the change in time. It only shows the A specific for the parameter values chosen. It thus depicts the plant photosynthesis in a steady state. This state is achievable for the plant systems themselves, but due to the many fluctuations of environmental conditions, it is never achieved in nature. This is why this model is not the most accurate representation of photosynthesis. However, it is still considered one of the best due to its simplicity."

Since photosynthesis is a convoluted mechanism, this model strives to include most components while simplifying where necessary. It builds upon previous works by Zhu et al., incorporating the reactions associated with light absorption, excitation energy transfer, charge separation, and electron transfer around PSII from their fluorescence induction model. Additionally, it introduces analogous reactions for PSI and includes reactions from their carbon metabolism model, such as those involved in the C<sub>3</sub> cycle, sucrose and starch synthesis, and photorespiration. The model further accounts for ion transfer between the lumen and stroma, ATP and NADPH synthesis, RuBisCO activation by RuBisCO activase, NPQ by luminal pH and the xanthophyll cycle, and regulation of enzyme activities by the ferredoxin (Fd) thioredoxin system.\n"
"\n Even though this model is very complex, it still introduces some simplifications; for example, the steps between the electron transfer of the chlorophyll *a* molecule and Fd are ignored. Furthermore, to calculate the A, this model uses the rate of carboxylation (V<sub>c</sub>) and the rate of glycine decarboxylase (v<sub>131</sub>).

During the day, they close their stomata to prevent water loss through transpiration and release the CO2 from the malate into the chloroplasts to be used in the Calvin Cycle, similar to C<sub>3</sub> plants. The name of this photosynthetic pathway, \"Crassulacean Acid Metabolism,\" was derived from the Crassulaceae plant family, where it was first discovered.

We will use the package `modelbase`, as it will make everything simpler than utilizing a Python integrator from scratch. To see the difference, go back to the **Computational Models** page, where you will see the same model being built using both methods.\n" 
"\n If you want to follow along, you can copy each code block and paste them into a Python IDE. At the end, you will have a complete model. The first thing we need to do with the `modelbase` package is define our model with the `Model()` class:"

Furthermore, some information is hidden behind the connection between compounds, which cannot be summarised as parameters.

We must first define the calculations as functions and then add them to the model."

We will demonstrate how to achieve this by extracting the simulation data from `modelbase`. However, there are several methods to accomplish this. It is worth noting that the graph will appear slightly different due to `modelbase` modifying certain plot aspects for faster processing. Nonetheless, we will ensure the diagram is aesthetically pleasing in the end."
