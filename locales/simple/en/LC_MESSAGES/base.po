msgid "INTRO"
msgstr "This is a Teaching Tool in Biology, a project launched by the **Computational Life Science Lab** at the RWTH Aachen \
        University, Germany. Our goal is to provide a teaching tool applicable to the needs of XXI-century students. We \
        want to show how computational modeling supports the current research in increasing our understanding of how the \
        world works. We have selected photosynthesis as THE process to demonstrate it. In the end, photosynthesis is arguably \
        the most important process on Earth! Why don't you start your adventure with this interactive dashboard by listening \
        about the process of photosynthesis."

msgid "USAGE"
msgstr "We aimed at both curious **newcomers** and more **advanced** learners. At any point of using this website you can choose \
        which version you want to use by clicking on the left side button: Version and selecting from the drop-down list \
        *Simple* or *Advanced*."


#: EINFÜHRUNG.py:26
msgid "ADVANCED_USE"
msgstr "If you do decide to choose the *Advanced* version, you will not only learn about photosynthesis \
        as a process, but also about methods how to measure its dynamics and how to calculate its efficiency using computer. \
        You will also learn how to 'genetically modify' your photosynthetic organism to perform new set of experiments, \
        meaning you will get to create a digital mutant. We call the work performed in computer in silico."
