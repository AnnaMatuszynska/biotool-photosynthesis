Plants are the basis of life on Earth (Fig. left), and plant adaptation is crucial for a functioning world. Varied conditions, e.g., changed temperatures (heat and cold), flooding events, and drought, can lead to stressful events in plants. As summarized in the Figure on the right, those factors can have various short- and long-term effects on plants. Nevertheless, plants experience stress upon sudden changes but have a *highly flexible metabolism* for adaptation. *One of the first reactions in plant metabolism is photosynthesis*, which **delivers energy** to sustain plant life. Photosynthesis itself is directly and indirectly affected by changed environmental conditions. Therefore, the analysis of photosynthesis and the fixation of CO₂ by plants is an essential measure of overall **plant fitness**, **productivity**, and **survival**. Consequently, basic research on photosynthesis and its efficiency is vital to assess our changing world."

On this page, you will learn how we can measure the dynamics of photosynthesis in real time using light (precisely fluorescence) measuring devices. As biology is continuously becoming a more quantitative science, numerous methods to probe photosynthesis exist. For example, as plants produce oxygen and take up carbon dioxide, photosynthesis can be measured by how fast these gasses are produced or consumed. However, metering gasses can be tricky, especially if you want to do it outside on a tree or field. Therefore, a significant characteristic of photosynthetic organisms is essential in providing alternative methods of measuring photosynthesis *in vivo*!"

When light shines on leaves, they use most of the light to run complex photochemical reactions of photosynthesis. Still, a small part of the absorbed light is reemitted. Something similar happens when your white T-shirt shines purple in a disco's black light. When something shines in a different light color when illuminated, this is called 'fluorescence'. And the plant's fluorescence shine is red."

A lot of light arrived at the leaf's parts not covered by the sticker. Because that light could be harmful, the plant quickly produced some chemicals acting as 'sunscreen' within the cells. After a few seconds, these cells were protected and received less light and fluoresced less. But, when we lifted the sticker, the cells below had not produced sunscreen. They saw the intense light and fluoresced at full force - right next to their protected neighbors. This sharp difference in fluorescence you saw as the stickers after-image. And as we continued shining the lamp, all cells adapted to it, vanishing the picture on the leaf."

Take a good look because, in a few minutes, you will produce similar results, not with the help of a fluorometer but with your computer! So, what do we see in this graph? It results from a unique light protocol, where a dark-adapted plant is exposed to very weak actinic light (AL, white area shown in the light bar, L), followed by dark recovery, where the light is switched off completely (black area in L). Multiple saturating light flashes (saturation pulses, SP) are applied before, during, and after the actinic illumination to measure the maximal fluorescence Fm, Fm', Fm'', respectively. We can use these fluorescence features to calculate the values quantifying photosynthesis, e.g., the amount of NPQ.\n\n So why do we exactly see any effect? This is explained with the upper left scheme. Light energy absorption brings chlorophyll molecules to the first excited state (S1 in the left diagram, a simplified 'Jablonsky diagram'). For chlorophylls to return to the ground state (S0), the absorbed energy can be used for charge separation and photosynthesis (photochemical quenching, qP), dissipated as heat (non-photochemical quenching, NPQ), or re-emitted as fluorescence. And now, the most crucial part: the fluorescence emission spectra are red-shifted from the absorption spectra. That means the fluorescence light is redder (at higher wavelengths in the left axis) than the light absorbed (upper panel on the right). This, in turn, means that the fluorescence can be detected using fluorometers with corresponding optical filters, and their signal will not be mistaken for the light that we shine on the plants. The emitted fluorescence signal is recorded with key readouts, as shown in the lower panel. It took us a long time to summarize everything on one figure only, and this figure originates from our previous work (Nies et al. 2021)."

This translation is yet to be one-to-one and imposes a certain level of **simplification**. Therefore, models are never a precise description, including all levels of details, but a simplification created with rigid methods for a specific study. The problem described using mathematical terms is then solved using mathematical techniques, today enormously aided with **computational** programs. The resulting solution is then applied to the real-world problem and evaluated. If additional solutions are required, the mathematical model must be revised.

This disease has surprised the people of Planet-X so that they separated their population into three categories: the ones that are susceptible to the disease and can get sick at any moment (S), the ones that recovered from the infection (R), and the currently infected ones (I). To model the transition between each category, we determine the rate of infection (v<sub>1</sub>) dependent on the number of S and I in the total population (N) and their rate of recovery (v<sub>2</sub>) solely reliant on the I. They also discovered that the R gain complete immunity, but the people are too stressed to grow their population. To know how their population will look in a few months, they try a new method they heard from Earth about, namely **mathematical modeling**. To start, you should create a scheme for your problem; in this case, the S will become I at a rate of v<sub>1</sub>, and the I will become R at a rate of v<sub>2</sub>. The rate v<sub>1</sub> is dependent on the infection rate of the disease (β), the number of S and I in relation to the N. On the other hand, the rate v<sub>2</sub> is only dependent on the number of I and their recovery rate (γ)."

A handy mathematical tool to depict the change of something depending on the change of another specific value is the so-called Ordinary Differential Equation&nbsp;(ODE). Using differential equations, you can describe the relationship between the time and the change in the number of people in each category, so overall, there are three equations. This set of three equations is called a system of ODEs and will be solved numerically using an integrator. So let's apply this method to our example of Planet-X, first by creating the ODE system:"

Let's apply this method to the disease on Planet-X. According to the scientists, the infection rate is (β&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), and the recovery rate is (γ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.2).

Actually, plants can perform their photosynthesis in a slightly different manner. Check the box below to learn more about the various forms of photosynthesis. The model was first created in 1980 by Graham Farquhar, Susanne von Caemmerer, and Joseph Berry and has since undergone many different variations and updates. The most basic version uses four equations, each depicting the A with a specific limiting rate. These include the RuBisCO limited rate (Ac), the electron transport limited rate (Aj), and the triphosphate limited rate (Ap), where the minimum of the three is taken as the end-resulting A. These equations include several different parameters that can be measured or estimated beforehand. This step is crucial as it gives life to the model, and by varying these, you alter the model's results. Please use the <a href='#' id='Advanced'>Advanced</a> mode to see these equations."

msgstr "This model is widely popular among scientists as, despite its simplicity, it accurately captures the carbon assimilation rate. As you may have guessed, this model type differs from the SIR model we explained earlier. It doesn’t use any ODEs and, therefore, cannot show the change in time. It only shows the A specific for the parameter values chosen. It, thus, depicts the plant photosynthesis in a steady state. This state is achievable for the plant systems themselves, but due to the many fluctuations of environmental conditions, it is never achieved in nature. This is why this model is not the most accurate representation of photosynthesis. However, it is still considered one of the best due to its simplicity."

These plants have a unique way of separating carbon fixation and the Calvin cycle, which involves opening their stomata at night to take in carbon dioxide and fixing it as a four-carbon organic acid, such as malate or malic acid, to store it in large vacuoles within their cells. During the day, they close their stomata to prevent water loss through transpiration and release the CO2 from the malate into the chloroplasts to be used in the Calvin Cycle, similar to C<sub>3</sub> plants. The name of this photosynthetic pathway, \"Crassulacean Acid Metabolism,\" was derived from the Crassulaceae plant family, where it was first discovered. Still, it is also present in other plant families like succulents, cacti, bromeliads, and some orchids. These types of plants are commonly found in desert regions and other areas with limited water resources."

By examining diagrams made with computer models, you have gained knowledge about the impact of light intensity on photosynthesis and delved into the subject of plant short-term memory. Consequently, you should have arrived at the following conclusions:\n"
"- Light intensity significantly affects the rate of photosynthesis in plants. As light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases to some degree.\n"
"- The relationship between light intensity and photosynthetic rate is not linear. Rather, it follows a curve that peaks at a certain saturation point."
