msgid   "EXPLANATION_MEASUREMENT"
msgstr  "The PAM measurement (Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorescence measurement) is used as the measurement method. In this case \
            photochemical quenching must first be excluded. For this purpose, the plant is irradiated with pulses of light \
            with strong intensity. The measured fluorescence can be attributed to NPQ if, at the \
            starting point the plant was dark-adapted. The change in fluorescence during light or \
            dark adaptations can be measured."

            These are the plants of the wild type (*Arabidopsis thaliana* ecotype Columbia 0: hereafter \
            Arabidopsis called). These plants grew for three weeks in soil at 23°C and were grown in a \
            cycle of 16h light and 8h night irradiated with 90-100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹. To ensure that the photosystem was not preloaded,\
            the plants were dark-adapted for 12h."
