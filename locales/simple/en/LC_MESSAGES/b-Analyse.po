msgid "INTRODUKTION"
msgstr "Now that you have been introduced to the measurement method for checking NPQ on plants, we will carry out measurements \
        with the model to estimate the influence of the abiotic influence factors."

msgid "TASK_1"
msgstr "Task 1"

#: pages/Analyse.py:
msgid "TASK_1_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "First of all, only adjust the slider with the light intensity. What do you notice?"

#: pages/Analyse.py:
msgid "TASK_2"
msgstr "Task 2"

#: pages/Analyse.py:
msgid "TASK_2_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "Now also changes the sliders for the duration of the experiment and the number of pulses. Describes the course of the \
        curve, which arises when you connect the peaks of the pulses."

        for the plant?"
