msgid "INTRODUCTION_CLIMATE_CHANGE"
msgstr "As plants **cannot run** away, they must adapt to their changed environmental conditions. Plants are the basis of \
        life on Earth (Fig. left), and plant adaptation is crucial for a functioning world. Varied conditions, like e.g., \
        changed temperatures (heat and cold), flooding events, and drought can lead to stressful events in plants. Those \
        factors can have various short- and long-term effects on plants– summarized in Fig. right. Nevertheless, plants \
        experience stress upon sudden changes but have a *highly flexible metabolism* for adaptation. *One of the first \
        reactions in plant metabolism is photosynthesis*, which **delivers energy** to sustain plant life. Photosynthesis \
        itself is directly and indirectly affected by changed environmental conditions. Therefore, the analysis of \
        photosynthesis and the fixation of CO₂ by plants is an important measure of overall **plant fitness**, **productivity**, \
        and **survival**. Consequently, basic research on photosynthesis and its efficiency is essential to assess our changing world."

        that can produce biomass are called **producers**. These include, in particular, plants. These can produce \
        biomass independently through photosynthesis, for example."

msgid "PHOTOSYNTHESIS_EXPLANATION_1"
msgstr "Just like humans, plants need nutrients for their growth. The most essential of these are water and minerals, \
        but plants also need fats, carbohydrates and proteins. Most of these nutrients plants can absorb from the soil \
        through their roots, but not all of them. As already mentioned, plants are producers and can therefore \
        manufacture nutrients. These nutrients include, in particular, carbohydrates, which are produced during photosynthesis."

msgid "PHOTOSYNTHESIS_EXPLANATION_2"
msgstr "In photosynthesis, plants produce biomass in the form of glucose. To do this, they need CO₂, H₂O and energy in \
        the form of light. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68b1HAIfX08) you can find out more about the process \
        of photosynthesis."

msgid "PHOTOSYNTHESIS_LOCATION_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "Photosynthesis takes place in the cells of the mostly green components of plants. In these cells are \
        specialized organelles the chloroplasts. There, the part of photosynthesis takes place, which \
        is called the light reaction. The so-called photosystems are located in the membrane. Photosystem II (PSII), \
        which uses the energy of light to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, is of particular interest to us. "

msgid "NPQ_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "What actually happens when too much light and thus excess energy hits the Photosystem II? Does it break down \
        and then have to be renewed by the cell? Fortunately not! Instead, the excess energy can be released in the \
        form of heat or used for ATP synthesis. In this way, the cell can be protected. The two non-photochemical \
        protective mechanisms are referred to as NPQ."
