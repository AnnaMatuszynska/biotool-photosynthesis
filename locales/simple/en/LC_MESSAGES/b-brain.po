msgstr "Since you have found out how plants react to different light intensities we have news for you! Plants can be actually *trained* to enhance their photoprotection. It has been observed experimentally that plants previously exposed to light react differently to light in comparison to those exposed to light for the first time! This phenomenon is sometimes called **short-term light memory* and we know now which molecular mechanism causes this effect. We have used this knowledge to represent the behaviour with a mathematical model and now, you can perform your own **memory experiments**. Go ahead, can simulate different scenarios using the two sliders below. Do you see how the fluorescence signal differs between different phases of the experiment? If you want to play even more, click the **Expert** version on the left."

#: Conclusion
msgid "BEGIN_OF_CONCLUTION"
msgstr "We hope you had a comprehensive introduction to the fascinating world of plant biology on this website. By \
        analyzing diagrams created with computer models, you were able to learn about the effects of light intensity \
        on photosynthesis and explore the topic of plant short-term memory. In doing so, you should have drawn the \
        following conclusions:"

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_1"
msgstr "- Light intensity has a significant effect on the rate of photosynthesis in plants. As light intensity \
        increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases to some degree."

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_2"
msgstr "- The relationship between light intensity and photosynthetic rate is not linear. Rather, it follows a curve \
        that peaks at a certain point, the saturation point."

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_3"
msgstr "- Plants have the ability to remember past light exposure and adjust their photosynthetic rates accordingly. \
        This short-term memory allows plants to optimize their energy consumption and adapt to changing environmental conditions."

#: Conclusion
msgid "END_OF_CONCLUTION"
msgstr "All in all, PAM measurement is an interesting and effective way to learn about the complex mechanisms \
        underlying plant growth and development. We encourage you to think about these conclusions and the broader \
        implications of these findings for our understanding of the natural world. In doing so, you will come to \
        appreciate even more the incredible complexity and beauty of the plant kingdom."
