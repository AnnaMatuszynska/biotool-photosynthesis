msgstr "Mathematical modeling involves creating mathematical models for use in various fields of research and industry. It is especially useful in situations where traditional testing methods are too expensive and time-consuming. Language of **mathematics** enables us translation of real processes, situation, and problems into general statements using equations. This translation is not yet one to one and imposes a certain level of **simplification**. Therefore models are never the precise description including all levels of details, but a simplification created with  rigid methods, for the purpose of a specific study. The problem described using mathematical terms is then solved using mathematical methods, today strongly aided with **computational** programs. The resulting solution is then applied to the real-world problem and evaluated. If additional solutions are required, the mathematical model must be revised. That way the process of model developing is often not a linear process but rather an iterative cycle, as presented on the figure below."

msgid "MATHEMATICAL_MODELLING_EXAMPLE"
msgstr "Let us imagine a scenario where a new highly contagious but overall harmless disease gets introduced to a population of aliens on Planet-X. This disease has surprised the people of Planet-X so that they separated their population into three categories, the one that are susceptible to the disease and can get sick at any moment (S), the one that recovered from the infection (R), and the currently infected ones (I). To model the transition between each cathegories we determine the rate of infection (v1) dependant on the number of S and I in the total population (N) and their rate of recovery (v2) solely dependant on the I (Equation 2). They also found out that the R have gained complete immunity, but the people are too stressed to grow their population. To know how their population will look in a few months, they try a new method they heard from Earth about, namely **mathematical modelling**. To start, you should create a scheme of your problem, in this case the S will become I at a rate of v1 and the I will become the R at a rate of v2."

msgid "MATHEMATICAL_MODELLING_EXAMPLE_2"
msgstr " With this scheme, you have already successfully modelled your problem; you just now have to be able to use it. To do that, you have to see what information you want to gather from your model, which is, in this case, the change in the population depending on the time. A very useful mathematical tool to depict the chnage of something depending on the change of another specific value, are the so-called Oridinary Differential Equation (ODE). If you have never seen what an ODE looks like, click the box Oridinary Differential Equations. Using differential equations you can describe the relationship between the time and change in the number of people in each of the cathegories, so overall three equations. This set of three equations will is called a system of ODE and will be solved numerically using an integrator. So let's apply this method to our example of Planet-X, first by creating the \ac{ODE} system:"

msgid "MATHEMATICAL_MODELLING_EXAMPLE_3"
msgstr "To effectively solve each ODE, it is important to consider the rates involved. With a predetermined scheme, one can determine which rate corresponds to removing or adding certain compounds. By using integration, one can calculate the amount of each compound at any given time and depict the change over time when doing so for multiple time points. Let's apply this method to the disease on Planet-X. According to the scientists, the infection rate is (α= 2) and the recovery rate is ($\beta = 0.2$). With these values and starting populations of (S=900), (I = 100), (R = 0), and ($\\mathrm{N} = \\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{I} + \\mathrm{R} = 1000$), we can solve our ODE system. The resulting graph shows that the population of Planet-X will eventually become completely immune."

        light-memory study we aimed at maximal reduction of the model complexity. We have therefore focused solely on \
        the pH regulated, non-photochemical processes associated with photosystem II and we included into the model only \
        those processes that are either directly affected by, or are regulating the extent of NPQ. So instead of modelling \
        the whole plant, or even the whole chloroplast, we applied a cycle of reduction (see Figure) based on a strict \
        reductionist approach, and managed to represent the model as a system of only six ordinary differential equations! \
