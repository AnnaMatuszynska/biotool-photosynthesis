Both contain chlorophyll reaction centers, which, upon light absorption, can oxidize compounds with high redox potential (e.g. H₂O) and reduce acceptors with low redox potential (e.g. NADP⁺).

msgstr "The covered parts of the leaf reduced the energy transfer onto the photosystems by inducing NPQ and, therefore, lessened (quenched) the fluorescence output. However, upon removal of the sticker, the covered tissue without induced light protection received intense illumination, producing a solid fluorescence response. As the edge of the sticker forms a sharp border region between high and low fluorescence regions, the after-image of the sticker is clearly visible. As the previously covered tissue induces a high light response, the after-image fades over time.\n Therefore, this experiment visualizes chlorophyll fluorescence and the leaf adaption to light."

msgstr "The above experiment also visualized the inverse relationship between fluorescence and the remaining dissipation modes of chlorophyll excitation. By measuring fluorescence, therefore, NPQ and photochemical quenching can also be metered. Additionally, high-light saturating light pulses lead to a 'closing' of PSII reaction centers where the electron donation to the following electron acceptor plastoquinone is much slower than the rate of incoming, exciting photons. This output limitation leads to a buildup of electrons inside the photosystem and, ultimately, a blockage of photochemical quenching. Therefore, quantifying the fluorescence of closed photosystems allows for inferring non-photochemical quenching."

msgid "MTH_INTRODUCTION_PHI"
msgstr "However, the fluorescence intensity is also proportional to the intensity of the incoming light. Therefore, the signal must be normalized to obtain the fraction of incoming energy dissipated as fluorescence, deemed the fluorescence yield. Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM, illustrated below) is one method to quantify this yield. PAM allows fluorescence yield measurements over time and under changing light conditions (dark, light, saturating, and others). Photosynthetic parameters like the photosynthetic efficiency 'ΦPSII' and NPQ can be quantified by relating measurements within a PAM protocol and observing the fluorescence dynamics."

# Grammarly checked

msgid "MTH_EXPLANATION_INTRODUCTION_ATTEMPTS"
msgstr "PAM employs a series of high-frequency light pulses with weak constant intensity, the measuring light (ML), to quantify the fluorescence yield. The pulses are too weak to induce significant photosynthetic activity but induce measurable fluorescence. As the exact timing of these measuring pulses is known, signal amplification through a lock-in amplifier selectively measures the fluorescence response to the constant-intensity pulses, which is proportional to the fluorescence yield (Schreiber, 2004).\n\nThe following figure visualizes the explained principles. The fluorescence yield measured throughout a typical PAM experiment can be seen in the bottom panel. The protocol involves a dark-adapted plant being exposed to weak constant ('actinic') light (AL, white area shown in the light bar, L), followed by dark recovery, where the light is switched off completely (black area in L). Multiple saturating light flashes (saturation pulses, SP) are applied before, during, and after the actinic illumination to measure the maximal fluorescence Fm, Fm', Fm'', respectively. These fluorescence features are used in the quantification of fluorescence parameters.\nThe upper half of the figure explains in more detail the fluorescence behavior of chlorophyll: Light energy absorption brings chlorophyll molecules to the first excited state (S1, see the simplified Jablonsky diagram in the upper panel on the left). For chlorophylls to return to the ground state (S0), the absorbed energy can be used for charge separation and photosynthesis (photochemical quenching, qP), dissipated as heat (non-photochemical quenching, NPQ), or re-emitted as fluorescence. The fluorescence emission spectra are red-shifted from the absorption spectra (upper panel on the right). Therefore, the fluorescence can be detected using fluorometers with corresponding optical filters, and their signal will not be mistaken for the irradiant light. The emitted fluorescence signal is recorded with key readouts, as the lower panel shows. This summary figure is reproduced from Nies et al. (2021)."

In this state, the measuring light is fully converted into fluorescence, and we measure the maximal fluorescence yield 'Fm'. While the standard fluorescence yield depends on the plant's photosynthesis, the Fm does not. So by comparing normal and maximal yield, we can tell apart changes in and outside photosynthesis, for example, the plant's light protection. When you also apply protocols of differently colored lights, you can calculate the previously mentioned ΦPSII, NPQ, and many other values. But how that is done goes much too far. Most important is that you understand that we compare what fraction of light is currently turned to fluorescence, how much at maximum, and how these measurements change over time and conditions."

Therefore, models are never a precise description, including all levels of details, but a simplification created with rigid methods for a specific study. The problem described using mathematical terms is then solved using mathematical techniques, today enormously aided with **computational** programs.

msgstr "Let us imagine a scenario where a new highly contagious but overall harmless disease gets introduced to a population of aliens on Planet-X. This disease has surprised the people of Planet-X so that they separated their population into three categories: the ones that are susceptible to the disease and can get sick at any moment (S), the ones that recovered from the infection (R), and the currently infected ones (I). To model the transition between each category, we determine the rate of infection (v<sub>1</sub>) dependent on the number of S and I in the total population (N) and their rate of recovery (v<sub>2</sub>) solely reliant on the I. They also discovered that the R gain complete immunity, but the people are too stressed to grow their population. To know how their population will look in a few months, they try a new method they heard from Earth about, namely **mathematical modeling**. To start, you should create a scheme for your problem; in this case, the S will become I at a rate of v<sub>1</sub>, and the I will become R at a rate of v<sub>2</sub>. The rate v<sub>1</sub> is dependent on the infection rate of the disease (β), the number of S and I in relation to the N. On the other hand, the rate v<sub>2</sub> is only dependent on the number of I and their recovery rate (γ)."

To do that, you have to see what information you want to gather from your model, which is, in this case, the change in the population depending on the time. A handy mathematical tool to depict the change of something depending on the change of another specific value is the so-called Ordinary Differential Equation&nbsp;(ODE). Using differential equations, you can describe the relationship between the time and the change in the number of people in each category, so overall, there are three equations. This set of three equations is called a system of ODEs and will be solved numerically using an integrator. So let's apply this method to our example of Planet-X, first by creating the ODE system:"

Let's apply this method to the disease on Planet-X. According to the scientists, the infection rate is (β&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), and the recovery rate is (γ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.2). With these values and starting populations of (S&nbsp;=&nbsp;900), (I&nbsp;=&nbsp;100), (R&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), and (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;S&nbsp;+&nbsp;I&nbsp;+&nbsp;R&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000), we can solve our ODE system.

While photosynthesis can broadly be summarized in three stages: light absorption, light reactions, and carbon fixation, this model only focuses on the latter. This provides a simplified view of C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis and is named after its primary contributors: Graham D. Farquhar, Susanne von Caemmerer, and Joseph A. Berry.

msgstr "The primary goal of the FvCB model is to describe carbon assimilation (A), which is the process of plants and other photosynthetic organisms incorporating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into organic compounds. This goal can be found in many photosynthetic models, as it is a critical factor for the plant's well-being, as the higher the A, the healthier the plant. As with everything in biology, it is more complex, but in a simplistic sense, this is a common way to see it. The FvCB model uses purely mathematical equations to calculate the A. Furthermore, it describes it as the minimum of three different limited As: the RuBisCO limited rate (A<sub>c</sub>), the electron transport limited rate (A<sub>j</sub>), and the triphosphate limited rate (A<sub>p</sub>). Using this model, you can easily calculate A utilizing a set of predefined and mostly measurable parameters and equations, as shown below:"

This is where dynamic models excel, like the SIR-model or other photosynthesis models."

We have created an interactive simulation using the four equations above to show you this simplicity. To not overwhelm you, you can change the O, J, and T<sub>p</sub>, which only change the different As (A<sub>c</sub>, A<sub>c</sub>, and A<sub>c</sub> respectively.

During the day, they close their stomata to prevent water loss through transpiration and release the CO2 from the malate into the chloroplasts to be used in the Calvin Cycle, similar to C<sub>3</sub> plants. The name of this photosynthetic pathway, \"Crassulacean Acid Metabolism,\" was derived from the Crassulaceae plant family, where it was first discovered.

msgstr "We can look at the graph in three phases:\n"
            "1. The first phase happens in darkness and, therefore, our initial modelled fluorescence is 'F₀'. We then simulate a saturating light pulse which rapidly inceases the fluorescence up to the peak value 'Fₘ'. Fₘ should be the overall maximal fluorescence the plant can produce so we usually compare the other fluorescence signals to it. 'Fₜ', the fluorescence simulated outside of saturating pulses, shows the photosystems behaviour under the actinic light. We see that Fₜ decreases back to the F₀-level afterwards, meaning that the plant recovers from having its photosystems saturated.\n"
            "2. We initiate the following phase with another saturating pulse. Since this peak fluorescence level (Fₘ') is the same as Fₘ, the plant doesn't seem to have activated any light protection yet. However, now, instead of returning to dark, we turn on the (actinic) light to 100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹. This leads to the fluorescence decreasing much more quickly after the saturating pulse and to a slightly higher level than F₀ which persists until the end of the experiment. The increased fluorescence yield shows us that the plant loses a larger amount of excitation energy to fluorescence now, implying that it is more stressed than it was in the dark.\n"
            "3. Indeed, when we proceed to give another saturating pulse, we see that the new maximum fluorescence Fₘ' is noticeably lower than Fₘ, showing us that non-photochemical quenching has been activated and is funnelling excitation energy away from both fluorescence and photosynthesis. You can find this observation directly reflected in the formula to estimate NPQ:"

#: pages/first_analysis.py:262
msgid "FAL_GRAPH_EXPLANATION_2"
msgstr  "The same way you can analyse simulation graphs with changed parameters and even more light phases. In general, observe how  Fₜ and Fₘ' behave over time, especially when the light condition is changed. Then, connect your oversations with your knowledge on NPQ.

msgstr "When changing the model parameters and doing another simulation, the old simulation graph will be displayed as a dashed line in the background of the new plot. This way, you can easily compare the two and investigate the effects of your change.\n\nIn the case shown, we increased the actinic light intensity from 100 (old) to 500 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ (new). Because the dark phase is the same in all simulations, there is no difference in phase one. After the saturating pulse in phase two, the higher light intensity's fluorescence (Fₜ₋₅₀₀) is strongly raised takes much longer to decrease. This behaviour implies that the photosystem is under much more light stress and  requires more time to sufficiently activate the NPQ. Phase three validates this hypothesis, as we simulate strongly reduced Fₘ's, resulting in increased estimated NPQ according to the previous formula. Lastly, we see that the plant reaches a similar final fluorescence as with the weaker actinic light, implying that by the strong NPQ activation a similarly low stress level is reached."

"    - The fluorescence at the very end of the very high light phase is increased compared to the low light simulation.

"    - Normally we assume that the pulses don't affect the photosynthesis. After a pulse the signal returns to the previous level and the peak height seems to decrease always the same.\n"
"    - However, if we give pulses in rapid succession under low light, the saturation pulses can have an effect like actinic light. You can see this if you try a light intensity of 50 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ with pulses every 5 s. There, the peak height decreases more than with fewer pulses. \n"
