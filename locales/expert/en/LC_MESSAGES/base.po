#: Intro by Anna
msgid "INTRO"
msgstr "This is a Teaching Tool in Biology: an ongoing project launched by Sarah Philipps and Anna Matuszyńska at the \
        RWTH Aachen University, Germany. Our goal is to provide a teaching tool applicable to the needs of a XXI century \
        students. We want to show how computational modeling supports the current research in increasing our understanding \
        how the world works, and we have selected photosynthesis as THE processs to demonstrate it with. At the end, \
        photosynthesis is arguably the most important process on Earth! We created this interactive dashboard, aimed at \
        both curious newcomers and more advanced learners. You can choose which Version you want to use by clicking on \
        the left side Version *Simple* or *Expert*. "

msgid "MOTIVATION"
msgstr "Dear users, on this website you have the opportunity to get to know a mathematical model in biology \
        to get to know. However, you will not only have the opportunity to get to know the model theoretically,\
        but also the possibility to work actively with the model."

msgid "PROCESS"
msgstr "On the Measurement Method page, the biological background to the model is explained first. On the following \
        pages you can work with the model."

#: EINFÜHRUNG.py:28
msgid "CONTINUING_TASK"
msgstr "The model used is a very simple one, since it contains only 6 differential equations with 41 \
        parameters. The photosystem II is simulated in order to calculate all necessary operations \
         for the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)."

#: EINFÜHRUNG.py:30
msgid "MOTIVATION_2.0"
msgstr "But why do we simulate the whole thing in the computer and not just make measurements on plants? There is a \
        simple explanation: It saves resources. The model can show how a plant reacts to different \
        light intensities without having to carry out experiments."

#: EINFÜHRUNG.py:32
msgid "DECLARATION"
msgstr "Another advantage of the model is that one can show the short term plant memory. This is discussed on the \
        Plant memory page."

        that can produce biomass are called **producers**. These include, in particular, plants. These can produce \

        purpose, plants have, on the one hand, roots that can absorb water and nutrients from the soil. On the other \
        hand, plants have stomata in their leaves, through which plants can absorb CO₂ from the air."

msgid "EXPANDER_PHOTOSYNTHESIS_EXPLANATION_1"
msgstr "Just like humans, plants need nutrients for their growth. The most essential of these are water and minerals, \
        but plants also need fats, carbohydrates and proteins. Most of these nutrients plants can absorb from the soil \
        through their roots, but not all of them. As already mentioned, plants are producers and can therefore \
        manufacture nutrients. These nutrients include, in particular, carbohydrates, which are produced during photosynthesis."

msgid "EXPANDER_PHOTOSYNTHESIS_EXPLANATION_2"
msgstr "In photosynthesis, plants produce biomass in the form of glucose. To do this, they need CO₂, H₂O and energy in \

msgid "EXPANDER_PHOTOSYNTHESIS_LOCATION_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "Photosynthesis takes place in the cells of the mostly green components of plants. In these cells are \
        specialized organelles the chloroplasts. There, the part of photosynthesis takes place, which \
        is called the light reaction. The so-called photosystems are located in the membrane. Photosystem II (PSII), \
        which uses the energy of light to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, is of particular interest to us. "

msgid "EXPANDER_NPQ_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "What actually happens when too much light and thus excess energy hits the Photosystem II? Does it break down \
        and then have to be renewed by the cell? Fortunately not! Instead, the excess energy can be released in the \
        form of heat or used for ATP synthesis. In this way, the cell can be protected. The two non-photochemical \
        protective mechanisms are referred to as NPQ."

        research and industry. In particular, whenever problems need to be solved that would be too costly to solve using \
        standard test procedures would cause too high costs. The problem is described mathematically and \
        Then the mathematical problem is solved with mathematical methods. The result must then be applied to \
        the real situation, i.e. the problem, and the solution can then be evaluated. If the solution \
        is not sufficient, the mathematical problem must be revised. The eventual successful mathematical \
        description of the problem is called a mathematical model."
