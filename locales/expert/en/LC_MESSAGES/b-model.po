msgstr "In the history of the Earth, several times climate changes occurred. In 2016, *97% of climate researchers* \
        agreed that currently we are in a human-caused global warming [Cook], and research is needed to understand the \
        impact of the sudden rise of Earth Temperature."

msgid "CONSTRUCTION_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "Photosynthesis is a complex process involving numerous players: proteins, enzymes, electron carriers, proton pumps, \
        ion channels and many more. Although each play an important role in the overall process, for the purpose of the \
        light-memory study we aimed at maximal reduction of the model complexity. We have therefore focused solely on \
        the pH regulated, non-photochemical processes associated with photosystem II and we included into the model only \
        those processes that are either directly affected by, or are regulating the extent of NPQ. So instead of modelling \
        the whole plant, or even the whole chloroplast, we applied a cycle of reduction (see Figure) based on a strict \
        reductionist approach, and managed to represent the model as a system of only six ordinary differential equations! \
        Each of the equations represents the dynamic rate of change in:"
