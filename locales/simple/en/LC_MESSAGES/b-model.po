msgid "INTRODUCTION_CLIMATE_CHANCE"
msgstr "As plants **cannot run** away, they must adapt to their changed environmental conditions. Plants are the basis of \
        life on Earth (Fig. left), and plant adaptation is crucial for a functioning world. Varied conditions, like e.g., \
        changed temperatures (heat and cold), flooding events, and drought can lead to stressful events in plants. Those \
        factors can have various short- and long-term effects on plantsâ€“ summarized in Fig. right. Nevertheless, plants \
        experience stress upon sudden changes but have a *highly flexible metabolism* for adaptation. *One of the first \
        reactions in plant metabolism is photosynthesis*, which **delivers energy** to sustain plant life. Photosynthesis \
        itself is directly and indirectly affected by changed environmental conditions. Therefore, the analysis of \
        photosynthesis and the fixation of CO2 by plants is an important measure of overall **plant fitness**, **productivity**, \
        and **survival**. Consequently, basic research on photosynthesis and its efficiency is essential to assess our changing world."

msgid "CONSTRUCTION_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "Photosynthesis is a complex process involving numerous players: proteins, enzymes, electron carriers, proton pumps, \
        ion channels and many more. Although each play an important role in the overall process, for the purpose of the \
        light-memory study we aimed at maximal reduction of the model complexity. We have therefore focused solely on \
        the pH regulated, non-photochemical processes associated with photosystem II and we included into the model only \
        those processes that are either directly affected by, or are regulating the extent of NPQ. So instead of modelling \
        the whole plant, or even the whole chloroplast, we applied a cycle of reduction (see Figure) based on a strict \
        reductionist approach, and managed to represent the model as a system of only six ordinary differential equations! \
        Each of the equations represents the dynamic rate of change in:"
