On this page you will learn how can we measure the dynamics of photosynthesis in real time using light (precisely fluorescence) measuring devices. As biology is continously becoming a more quantitative science, obviously numerous methods to probe photosynthesis exist. For example, as plants produce oxygen and take up carbon dioxide, photosynthesis can be measured by how fast these gasses are produced or consumed. However, metering gasses can be tricky, especially if you want to do it outside on a tree or in a field. Therefore a particularly important characteristic of photosynthetic organisms is essential in providing alternative methods of measuring photosynthesis *in vivo*!"

When light shines on leaves, they use majority of the light to run complex photochemical reactions of photosynthesis, but a small part of the absorbed light is reemitted. Something similar happens when your white \
        T-shirt shines purple in a disco's black light. When something shine in a different light color when illuminated, \
        this is called 'fluorescence'. And the plant's fluorescence shine is red."

        Plants don't absorb green light and instead reflect it, which we see as their primary color. Their red shine, \
        however, is much fainter than that, and with stronger light coming into our eyes from all directions, we just can't see it."

        distracting light and focus on the red fluorescence. Now watch what happens:"

        action. Because the plant cannot move, it must adjust to its surroundings. A lot of light arrived at the leaf's \
        parts not covered by the sticker. Because that light could be harmful, the plant quickly produced some chemicals \
        acting as a kind of sunscreen within the cells. After a few seconds, these cells were protected and received less \
        light and fluoresced less. But, when we lifted the sticker, the cells below had not produced sunscreen. They saw \
        the intense light and fluoresced at full force - right next to their protected neighbors. This sharp difference \
        in fluorescence you saw as the stickers after-image. And as we continued shining the lamp, all cells adapted to \
        it, vanishing the picture on the leaf."

        say for now how strongly the plant photosynthesizes also has an effect on the strength of the reemitted light signal."

        we might be interested in: How healthy the leaf is, how much it protects itself from the light, and, most \
        importantly, how it is doing photosynthesis. We name this last measurement 'ΦPSII', with the greek letter 'Psi', \
        and you might see it along some of the graphs you will produce later. The higher it is, the better, as the plant \
        is doing photosynthesis more efficiently."

msgstr "In this one figure the basic principles behind the fluorescence and PAM experiment are explained. \
In the bottom panel you see results of the PAM experiments. Take a good look, cause in few minutes you will be producing similar results but not with a help of a fluorometer but your computer! So what do we see in this graph? It is a result of a special light protocol, where a dark-adapted plant is exposed to very weak, actinic light (AL, white area shown in the light bar, L) followed by dark recovery, where the light is switched off completely (black area in L). Multiple saturating light flashes (saturation pulses, SP) are applied before, during and after the actinic illumination to measure the maximal fluorescence Fm, Fm', Fm'', respectively. So why do we exactly see any effect? This is explained with the upper left scheme. Light energy absorption brings chlorophyll molecules to the first excited state (S1, see the simplified Jablonsky diagram in the upper panel on the left). For chlorophylls to return to the ground state (S0), the absorbed energy can be used for charge separation and photosynthesis (photochemical quenching, qP), dissipated as heat (non-photochemical quenching, NPQ), or re-emitted as fluorescence. And now, the most important part: the fluorescence emission spectra are red-shifted from the absorption spectra (upper panel on the right). This basically means that the fluorescence can be detected using fluorometers with corresponding optical filters and their signal will not be mistaken with the light that we actually shine on the plants. The emitted fluorescence signal is recorded, as shown in the lower panel with key readouts. It took us a long time to summarize everything on one figure only and this figure originates from our previous work (Nies et al. 2021)."

        pulse every few seconds, overloading its photosynthetic machinery. In this state, the measuring light is fully \
        converted into fluorescence, and we measure the maximal fluorescence yield 'Fm'. While the standard fluorescence \
        yield depends on the plant's photosynthesis, the Fm does not. So by comparing normal and maximal yield, we can \
        tell apart changes in and outside of photosynthesis, for example, the plant's light protection. When you then \
        also apply protocols of differently colored lights, you can calculate the previously mentioned ΦPSII, NPQ, and \
        many other values. But how that is done goes much too far. Most important is that you understand that we compare \
        what fraction of light is currently turned to fluorescence, how much at maximum, and how these measurements change \

To model the transition between each cathegories we determine the rate of infection (v1) dependant on the number of S and I in the total population (N) and their rate of recovery (v2) solely dependant on the I (Equation 2). They also found out that the R have gained complete immunity, but the people are too stressed to grow their population. To know how their population will look in a few months, they try a new method they heard from Earth about, namely **mathematical modelling**.

A very useful mathematical tool to depict the chnage of something depending on the change of another specific value, are the so-called Oridinary Differential Equation (ODE). If you have never seen what an ODE looks like, click the box Oridinary Differential Equations. Using differential equations you can describe the relationship between the time and change in the number of people in each of the cathegories, so overall three equations. This set of three equations will is called a system of ODE and will be solved numerically using an integrator.

Let's apply this method to the disease on Planet-X. According to the scientists, the infection rate is (α= 2) and the recovery rate is ($\beta = 0.2$). With these values and starting populations of (S=900), (I = 100), (R = 0), and ($\\mathrm{N} = \\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{I} + \\mathrm{R} = 1000$), we can solve our ODE system.

        light-memory study we aimed at maximal reduction of the model complexity. We have therefore focused solely on \

        those processes that are either directly affected by, or are regulating the extent of NPQ. So instead of modelling \
        the whole plant, or even the whole chloroplast, we applied a cycle of reduction (see Figure) based on a strict \
        reductionist approach, and managed to represent the model as a system of only six ordinary differential equations! \

#: Conclusion
msgid "BEGIN_OF_CONCLUTION"
msgstr "We hope you had a comprehensive introduction to the fascinating world of plant biology on this website. By \
        analyzing diagrams created with computer models, you were able to learn about the effects of light intensity \
        on photosynthesis and explore the topic of plant short-term memory. In doing so, you should have drawn the \
        following conclusions:"

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_1"
msgstr "- Light intensity has a significant effect on the rate of photosynthesis in plants. As light intensity \
        increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases to some degree."

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_2"
msgstr "- The relationship between light intensity and photosynthetic rate is not linear. Rather, it follows a curve \
        that peaks at a certain point, the saturation point."

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_3"
msgstr "- Plants have the ability to remember past light exposure and adjust their photosynthetic rates accordingly. \
        This short-term memory allows plants to optimize their energy consumption and adapt to changing environmental conditions."

#: Conclusion
msgid "END_OF_CONCLUTION"
msgstr "All in all, PAM measurement is an interesting and effective way to learn about the complex mechanisms \
        underlying plant growth and development. We encourage you to think about these conclusions and the broader \
        implications of these findings for our understanding of the natural world. In doing so, you will come to \
        appreciate even more the incredible complexity and beauty of the plant kingdom."
