Plants are the basis of life on Earth (Fig. left), and plant adaptation is crucial for a functioning world. Varied conditions, e.g., changed temperatures (heat and cold), flooding events, and drought, can lead to stressful events in plants. As summarized in the Figure on the right, those factors can have various short- and long-term effects on plants. Nevertheless, plants experience stress upon sudden changes but have a *highly flexible metabolism* for adaptation. *One of the first reactions in plant metabolism is photosynthesis*, which **delivers energy** to sustain plant life. Photosynthesis itself is directly and indirectly affected by changed environmental conditions. Therefore, the analysis of photosynthesis and the fixation of CO₂ by plants is an essential measure of overall **plant fitness**, **productivity**, and **survival**. Consequently, basic research on photosynthesis and its efficiency is vital to assess our changing world."

Take a step towards the tree and look at the leaf. It has an intricate structure with a network of veins running through a sheet of green photosynthetic cells. And there are other cells: Plant hairs, gas-exchanging stomates, and more. Even in just a leaf, there are many different functioning sets that all warrant investigation.\n\nBut let's again focus on the green cells, the mesophyll, cells place of most photosynthesis. So imagine taking another step forward and looking inside the cell. You see it filled to the brim with again different parts with their own jobs: The vacuole, which gives the cell structure; the nucleus packing the genetic information; the chloroplast, where the light is being captured; and so many more organelles. And let's take another step towards the chloroplast to investigate how light gives energy to our cell.\n\nOn this level, you see how the light hits the millions of proteins that do their jobs within this confined space. Special ones among them, the photosystems, can take up that light, juggle with electrons, and pass them on. A whole miniature machinery is fueled by them, leading to the production and consumption of things. Many of them leave or enter the chloroplasts from other parts of the cell. Everything changes constantly! And in there, we sit and wonder: How does photosynthesis work?"

msgid "PHO_NPQ_EXPLANATION"
msgstr "If the photosystems absorb too much light energy, protein breakdown, and cellular damage by producing radical oxygen species can ensue. Therefore, multiple preventive mechanisms exist to reduce high light damage, ranging from the adaption of the photosystems to the movement of chloroplasts and whole leaves. Processes on the scale of the photosystems are acting the fastest and usually result in light energy being directly emitted as heat. Such processes are collectively called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)."

msgid "PHO_NPQ_EXPLANATION_DETAILED"
msgstr "**Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)** is a protective mechanism employed by photosynthetic organisms to avoid damage of their photosystems by an excess of light energy. NPQ involves both rapid and slower mechanisms that are reversible and lead to a reduction in the efficiency of the photosynthetic process under conditions of excess light. This reduction in efficiency is achieved by dissipating the excess light energy as heat, rather than using it for photosynthesis. NPQ therefore although reducing the conversion rate acts as a safety valve, helping to protect the photosynthetic apparatus from potential damage."

msgid "PHO_NPQ_EXPLANATION_CONTINUED"

Zeaxanthin can absorb photons and emit the excitation energy as heat, thus, protecting the photosystems from overexcitation. The fast de-epoxidation towards Zeaxanthin is catalyzed by the Violaxanthin de-epoxidase, which is activated by the low thylakoidal pH during high light. Inversely, the slow epoxidation of Zeaxanthin happens preferably under the higher pHs in low light.."

As the edge of the sticker forms a sharp border region between high and low fluorescence regions, the after-image of the sticker is clearly visible.

msgstr "The above experiment also visualized the inverse relationship between fluorescence and the remaining dissipation modes of chlorophyll excitation. By measuring fluorescence, therefore, NPQ and photochemical quenching can also be metered. Additionally, high-light saturating light pulses lead to a 'closing' of PSII reaction centers where the electron donation to the following electron acceptor plastoquinone is much slower than the rate of incoming, exciting photons. This output limitation leads to a buildup of electrons inside the photosystem and, ultimately, a blockage of photochemical quenching. Therefore, quantifying the fluorescence of closed photosystems allows for inferring non-photochemical quenching."

msgstr "However, the fluorescence intensity is also proportional to the intensity of the incoming light. Therefore, the signal must be normalized to obtain the fraction of incoming energy dissipated as fluorescence, deemed the fluorescence yield. Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM, illustrated below) is one method to quantify this yield. PAM allows fluorescence yield measurements over time and under changing light conditions (dark, light, saturating, and others). Photosynthetic parameters like the photosynthetic efficiency 'ΦPSII' and NPQ can be quantified by relating measurements within a PAM protocol and observing the fluorescence dynamics."

msgid "MTH_VIDEO_TRANSCRIPT_PAM"
msgstr "Have you ever wondered how scientists measure the photosynthetic activity of plants? One way is through a PAM measurement. PAM stands for Pulse Amplitude Modulation, and it measures the fluorescence of chlorophyll molecules within a leaf. We are going to be using this PAM fluorometer to measure the fluorescence of chlorophyll in a plant. First, we need to make sure that the plant is dark-adapted for at least 12 hours. Next, we will clip this probe onto the leaf and flash it with a brief pulse of light. The chlorophyll molecules will absorb the light and emit a burst of fluorescence, which we can measure with the detector.\n\nWe start the measurement that gives us a graph of the fluorescence emitted by the chlorophyll molecules over time. This graph can tell us about the photosynthetic stress of the plant. The graph has several parameters, including F0, which is the initial fluorescence level before the pulse of light, and Fm, which is the maximum fluorescence level. The ratio of Fv to Fm gives us a maximum Quantum efficiency of the photosystem two, which is an indicator of the plant's overall health. Through PAM measurements, scientists can gain insights into the photosynthetic health of plants, which can help with crop management and climate change research."

msgstr "PAM employs a series of high-frequency light pulses with weak constant intensity, the measuring light (ML), to quantify the fluorescence yield. The pulses are too weak to induce significant photosynthetic activity but induce measurable fluorescence. As the exact timing of these measuring pulses is known, signal amplification through a lock-in amplifier selectively measures the fluorescence response to the constant-intensity pulses, which is proportional to the fluorescence yield (Schreiber, 2004).\n\nThe following figure visualizes the explained principles. The fluorescence yield measured throughout a typical PAM experiment can be seen in the bottom panel. The protocol involves a dark-adapted plant being exposed to weak constant ('actinic') light (AL, white area shown in the light bar, L), followed by dark recovery, where the light is switched off completely (black area in L). Multiple saturating light flashes (saturation pulses, SP) are applied before, during, and after the actinic illumination to measure the maximal fluorescence Fm, Fm', Fm'', respectively. These fluorescence features are used in the quantification of fluorescence parameters.\nThe upper half of the figure explains in more detail the fluorescence behavior of chlorophyll: Light energy absorption brings chlorophyll molecules to the first excited state (S1, see the simplified Jablonsky diagram in the upper panel on the left). For chlorophylls to return to the ground state (S0), the absorbed energy can be used for charge separation and photosynthesis (photochemical quenching, qP), dissipated as heat (non-photochemical quenching, NPQ), or re-emitted as fluorescence. The fluorescence emission spectra are red-shifted from the absorption spectra (upper panel on the right). Therefore, the fluorescence can be detected using fluorometers with corresponding optical filters, and their signal will not be mistaken for the irradiant light. The emitted fluorescence signal is recorded with key readouts, as the lower panel shows. This summary figure is reproduced from Nies et al. (2021)."

In this state, the measuring light is fully converted into fluorescence, and we measure the maximal fluorescence yield 'Fm'. While the standard fluorescence yield depends on the plant's photosynthesis, the Fm does not. So by comparing normal and maximal yield, we can tell apart changes in and outside photosynthesis, for example, the plant's light protection. When you also apply protocols of differently colored lights, you can calculate the previously mentioned ΦPSII, NPQ, and many other values. But how that is done goes much too far.

It is beneficial when traditional testing methods are too expensive and time-consuming. The language of **mathematics** enables us to translate real processes, situations, and problems into general statements using equations. This translation is yet to be one-to-one and imposes a certain level of **simplification**. Therefore, models are never a precise description, including all levels of details, but a simplification created with rigid methods for a specific study. The problem described using mathematical terms is then solved using mathematical techniques, today enormously aided with **computational** programs. The resulting solution is then applied to the real-world problem and evaluated. If additional solutions are required, the mathematical model must be revised.

Depending on what you're interested in, there are many ways of doing this, and often, you will need to put a lot of time and data into your model to make it work. But that work pays off because now you don't have to ponder on what happens but you can calculate and simulate it. And this is the part that makes modelling special: What you simulate is up to you. You can change about the model what you like and find out what that does. For example, try out a new protein and reaction on the cell; change the light and environment and see how your cell does there; and if you've measured some data, see if your model behaves the same. You could even try to find out what keeps the cell from making much sugar! There are so many possibilities. If you can program it, you can try it. Because today, this research is done digitally.

msgstr "Now that you have been introduced to the experimental method of measuring photosynthetic fluorescence, you probably would like to take such measurements yourself. And you can! On this site, you will carry out measurements with the model, meaning **in silico**, to estimate the influence of the **abiotic** (representing physical rather than biological, like light intensity) influence factors. To make your work as easy as possible, all you need to run the model is to provide the light intensity for which you want to run your experiment, the length of this experiment (in minutes), and the time between the saturating pulses of light. You can do it using sliders.\n\n The graph will display the fluorescence as an orange line during an initial dark phase (blue background) and a following light phase (orange background) with choosable intensity. Saturating light pulses are given at the beginning of the dark phase and in the light, which you can see as spikes in the fluorescence signal."

Now, you can adjust the PAM parameters with the sliders to create your individual test scenario and click the button to see the resulting graph.\n\nBut how do we analyze the graph? Well, that depends on what you are looking for. The fluorescence is plotted on the y-axis, and the times are plotted on the x-axis. For the fluorescent, the maximum fluorescence at the saturation pulse was measured first. Then, the measured fluorescence was plotted by the maximum fluorescence. To see the increase or decrease of the stress of the plant over a period of time, we could connect the peaks of the pulses and look at the progression. Finally, I want to share two tips with you: First, if you want to compare two PAM tests, you can download the graphs by clicking the three dots in the top right corner.

msgstr "We can look at the graph in three phases:\n"
            "1. The first phase happens in darkness and, therefore, our initial modelled fluorescence is 'F₀'. We then simulate a saturating light pulse which rapidly increases the fluorescence up to the peak value 'Fₘ'. Fₘ should be the overall maximal fluorescence the plant can produce so we usually compare the other fluorescence signals to it. 'Fₜ', the fluorescence simulated outside of saturating pulses, shows the photosystems behavior under the actinic light. We see that Fₜ decreases back to the F₀-level afterwards, meaning that the plant recovers from having its photosystems saturated.\n"
            "2. We initiate the following phase with another saturating pulse. Since this peak fluorescence level (Fₘ') is the same as Fₘ, the plant doesn't seem to have activated any light protection yet. However, now, instead of returning to dark, we turn on the (actinic) light to 100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹. This leads to the fluorescence decreasing much more quickly after the saturating pulse and to a slightly higher level than F₀ which persists until the end of the experiment. The increased fluorescence yield shows us that the plant loses a larger amount of excitation energy to fluorescence now, implying that it is more stressed than it was in the dark.\n"
            "3. Indeed, when we proceed to give another saturating pulse, we see that the new maximum fluorescence Fₘ' is noticeably lower than Fₘ, showing us that non-photochemical quenching has been activated and is funnelling excitation energy away from both fluorescence and photosynthesis. You can find this observation directly reflected in the formula to estimate NPQ:"

#: pages/first_analysis.py:262
msgid "FAL_GRAPH_EXPLANATION_2"
msgstr  "The same way you can analyze simulation graphs with changed parameters and even more light phases. In general, observe how  Fₜ and Fₘ' behave over time, especially when the light condition is changed. Then, connect your observations with your knowledge on NPQ. If you are interested, you could also use the calculated estimated of NPQ and and PSII efficiency."

msgstr "When changing the model parameters and doing another simulation, the old simulation graph will be displayed as a dashed line in the background of the new plot. This way, you can easily compare the two and investigate the effects of your change.\n\nIn the case shown, we increased the actinic light intensity from 100 (old) to 500 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ (new). Because the dark phase is the same in all simulations, there is no difference in phase one. After the saturating pulse in phase two, the higher light intensity's fluorescence (Fₜ₋₅₀₀) is strongly raised takes much longer to decrease. This behavior implies that the photosystem is under much more light stress and  requires more time to sufficiently activate the NPQ. Phase three validates this hypothesis, as we simulate strongly reduced Fₘ's, resulting in increased estimated NPQ according to the previous formula. Lastly, we see that the plant reaches a similar final fluorescence as with the weaker actinic light, implying that by the strong NPQ activation a similarly low stress level is reached."

"    - The fluorescence signal after turning on the light, shortly after the peak, is a lot higher. This is because chlorophyll receives much more energy which puts the plant under light stress.\n"
"    - The later saturation pulses, after ca. two minutes, are shorter than those under low light. Therefore the plant has increased the heat quenching, aka NPQ, as a light protection mechanism.\n"
"2. :blue[On a hot and sunny day, higher intensities of over 900 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ actinic light can be reached. Try this in a simulation and see if you previous observations also hold here.]\n"
"    - For this higher light intensity we can see as well the increased fluorescence after light-on and the further decreasing fluorescence during the pulses.\n"
"    - The fluorescence at the very end of the very high light phase is increased compared to the low light simulation. Therefore, even after full activation of it's NPQ mechanism, the plant is still more stressed. Likely, the quenching potential of the plant's NPQ process is exhausted and higher light might damage the plant.\n"
"3. :blue[At this intensity, we can see much better how the fluorescence peaks during the saturation pulses lower over time. But a lot seems to happen in the first two minutes that we cannot see.]\n"
"    - With more frequent pulses, we can see the dropping peak fluorescence more clearly. Therefore, we see the NPQ activation in a higher resolution and could try to fit a function to estimate the activation rate.\n"
"    - Normally we assume that the pulses don't affect the photosynthesis. After a pulse the signal returns to the previous level and the peak height seems to decrease always the same.\n"
"    - However, if we give pulses in rapid succession under low light, the saturation pulses can have an effect like actinic light. You can see this if you try a light intensity of 50 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ with pulses every 5 s. There, the peak height decreases more than with fewer pulses. \n"
"4. :blue[The longer an experiment takes, the more work it is for the experimenter. Try lowering the measuring time to 1 min, then increase it to 10 min.]\n"
"    - With a light intensity of 500 to 900 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ the NPQ adaption seems to be finished after three to four seconds. We should measure at least this long to capture the whole process.\n"

"    - With a high frequency of saturation pulses we can also see that this maximal activity is reached faster.\n"

"    - Are changes in the two rates additive?\n"
"6. :blue[The plant's NPQ mechanism relaxes in the dark after the saturating pulse. Is this necessary?]\n"
"    - When we shorten the dark phase to less than 10-15 seconds, the relaxation after the dark saturation pulse isn't completed yet. Therefore, when we turn on the actinic light, we initially overestimate the fluorescence and the estimated stress level.\n"
"7. :blue[It is very important, that the saturating pulses are actually saturating to get meaningful results. What happens if they are not?]\n"
"    - The fluorescence simulation minimally changes when increasing the saturation pulse to maximum intensity. The higher light intensity \n"
"    - Below ca. 2000 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ the peak height difference is clearly noticeable. From there, the Fₜ level seems generally increased as the fluorescence is normalized to the undersaturated Fₘ. Both factors lead to a strong overestimation of NPQ and an underestimated Φ(PSII)."
