#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_1"
msgstr "- Light intensity has a significant effect on the rate of photosynthesis in plants. As light intensity \

#: Conclusion

        you heard that plants produce oxygen and take up carbon dioxide. Therefore, photosynthesis can be measured by \
        how fast these gasses are produced or consumed. However, metering gasses can be tricky, especially if you want \

msgid "INTRODUCTION_GLOWING"
msgstr "Here is where a specialty of plants comes into play: They can glow! When light shines on them, they not only \
        photosynthesize, but also release a small part of that absorbed light. Something similar happens when your white \
        T-shirt shines purple in a disco's black light. When something glows in a different light color when illuminated, \
        this is called 'fluorescence'. And the plant's fluorescence glow is red."

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "PLANT_ARE_SHINING_RED"
msgstr "Now you might think: 'But plants are green, and I have never seen one fluoresce!'. And, of course, this is right. \
        Plants don't absorb green light and instead reflect it, which we see as their primary color. Their red glow, \
        however, is much fainter than that, and with stronger light coming into our eyes from all directions, we just can't see it."

        focus on the red fluorescence. Now watch what happens:"

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "EXPLANATION_VIDEO"
msgstr "Did you see the red glow and the sticker's ghostly imprint on the leaf? You just saw the plant's adaptation in \
        action. Because the plant cannot move, it must adjust to its surroundings. A lot of light arrived at the leaf's \
        parts not covered by the sticker. Because that light could be harmful, the plant quickly produced some chemicals \
        acting as a kind of sunscreen within the cells. After a few seconds, these cells were protected and received less \
        light and fluoresced less. But, when we lifted the sticker, the cells below had not produced sunscreen. They saw \
        the intense light and fluoresced at full force - right next to their protected neighbors. This sharp difference \
        in fluorescence you saw as the stickers after-image. And as we continued shining the lamp, all cells adapted to \
        it, vanishing the picture on the leaf."

msgid "EXPLANATION_MEASUREMENT_1"
msgstr "This experiment showed you the shine of plants and how amazingly they can adjust to the light. But how can this \
        help with testing photosynthesis? A lot, actually. Because not only the 'sunscreen' affects leaf fluorescence, \
        but many other factors do, too. If you are interested in how this happens, look into the [Expert] section. Let's \
        say for now how strongly the plant photosynthesizes also has an effect on the strength of the reemitted light signal."


#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "INTRODUCTION_PHI"
msgstr "So scientists invented a way to measure this fluorescence and track how it changes over time (you \
        will hear about this 'PAM' later). With some clever maths behind it, they can then calculate a lot of the things \
        we might be interested in: How healthy the leaf is, how much it protects itself from the light, and, most \
        importantly, how it is doing photosynthesis. We name this last measurement 'ΦPSII', with the greek letter 'Psi', \
        and you might see it along some of the graphs you will produce later. The higher it is, the better, as the plant \
        is doing photosynthesis more efficiently."

        (intensity) of light flashes."

msgstr "Measuring Light and Fluoreszenz"

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "EXPLANATION_INTRODUCTION_ATTEMPTS"
msgstr "Indeed, we shine a very tight series of short and weak light flashes on the plant, over a thousand each second! \
        With this flashing, we measure the plant performance and call it 'measuring light'. The measuring light is too \
        weak to be used for photosynthesis, but strong enough to get the plant to fluoresce. And, since we produce \
        fluorescence with each flash, the resulting signal is patterned (modulated), just like the measuring light."

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid   "EXPLANATION_MEASUREMENT_2"
msgstr  "This patterning is essential because we want to measure photosynthesis under natural conditions, outside and in \
        different irradiation when the plant already fluoresces. Typically, we would not be able to tell apart the \
        fluorescence produced by the outside and the measuring light. But, because our measuring light and its resulting \
        fluorescence are -modulated-, with some clever math, we can calculate how much fluorescence was caused by just \
        our measuring light. And because all the flashes were the same, we measured the fraction of light turned to \
        fluorescence - a fluorescence yield. This yield is what you will see in the model graphs. It decreases when the \
        plant's photosynthesis is more efficient, with more powerful light protection, and many more factors also affect \
        it. And it is comparable regardless of the outside light - a versatile measurement."

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid   "EXPLANATION_ATTEMPTS"
msgstr  "You need to know one more aspect of PAM, the saturating pulses. Our machine gives the plant a very intense light \
        pulse every few seconds, overloading its photosynthetic machinery. In this state, the measuring light is fully \
        converted into fluorescence, and we measure the maximal fluorescence yield 'Fm'. While the standard fluorescence \
        yield depends on the plant's photosynthesis, the Fm does not. So by comparing normal and maximal yield, we can \
        tell apart changes in and outside of photosynthesis, for example, the plant's light protection. When you then \
        also apply protocols of differently colored lights, you can calculate the previously mentioned ϕPSII, NPQ, and \
        many other values. But how that is done goes much too far. Most important is that you understand that we compare \
        what fraction of light is currently turned to fluorescence, how much at maximum, and how these measurements change \
        over time and conditions."

The problem described using mathematical terms is then solved using mathematical techniques, today enormously aided with **computational** programs. The resulting solution is then applied to the real-world problem and evaluated. If additional solutions are required, the mathematical model must be revised. That way, the model development process is often not linear but an iterative cycle, as presented in the figure below."

msgstr "Let us imagine a scenario where a new highly contagious but overall harmless disease gets introduced to a population of aliens on Planet-X. This disease has surprised the people of Planet-X so that they separated their population into three categories, the ones that are susceptible to the disease and can get sick at any moment (S), the ones that recovered from the infection (R), and the currently infected ones (I). To model the transition between each category, we determine the rate of infection (v1) dependent on the number of S and I in the total population (N) and their rate of recovery (v2) solely reliant on the I (Equation 2). They also discovered that the R gain complete immunity, but the people are too stressed to grow their population. To know how their population will look in a few months, they try a new method they heard from Earth about, namely **mathematical modeling**. To start, you should create a scheme for your problem; in this case, the S will become I at a rate of v1, and the I will become R at a rate of v2."

msgstr "With this scheme, you have already successfully modeled your problem; you just now have to be able to use it. To do that, you have to see what information you want to gather from your model, which is, in this case, the change in the population depending on the time. A handy mathematical tool to depict the change of something depending on the change of another specific value is the so-called Ordinary Differential Equation&nbsp;(ODE). If you have never seen what an ODE looks like, click the box Ordinary Differential Equations. Using differential equations, you can describe the relationship between the time and change in the number of people in each category, so overall, three equations. This set of three equations is called a system of ODEs and will be solved numerically using an integrator. So let's apply this method to our example of Planet-X, first by creating the ODE system:"

msgstr "To effectively solve each ODE, it is crucial to consider the rates involved. With a predetermined scheme, one can determine which rate corresponds to removing or adding certain compounds. By using integration, one can calculate the amount of each compound at any given time and depict the change over time when doing so for multiple time points. Let's apply this method to the disease on Planet-X. According to the scientists, the infection rate is (β&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), and the recovery rate is (γ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.2). With these values and starting populations of (S&nbsp;=&nbsp;900), (I&nbsp;=&nbsp;100), (R&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), and N&nbsp;=&nbsp;S&nbsp;+&nbsp;I&nbsp;+&nbsp;R&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000, we can solve our ODE system. The resulting graph shows that the disease on Planet-X will eventually be irradicated on its own."

Although each play an important role in the overall process, for the purpose of the light-memory study we aimed at maximal reduction of the model complexity. We have therefore focused solely on the pH regulated, non-photochemical processes associated with photosystem II and we included into the model only those processes that are either directly affected by, or are regulating the extent of NPQ. So instead of modelling the whole plant, or even the whole chloroplast, we applied a cycle of reduction (see Figure) based on a strict reductionist approach, and managed to represent the model as a system of only six ordinary differential equations!
