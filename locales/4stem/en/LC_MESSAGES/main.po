Such processes are collectively called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The following pages will present the model representing the plant 'Xanthophyll cycle', where the enzymatic interconversion of carotenoids leads to a system with tunable light absorption for dissipation as heat."

As the edge of the sticker forms a sharp border region between high and low fluorescence regions, the after-image of the sticker is clearly visible. As the previously covered tissue induces a high light response, the after-image fades over time.\n Therefore, this experiment visualizes chlorophyll fluorescence and the leaf adaption to light."

msgstr "The above experiment also visualized the inverse relationship between fluorescence and the remaining dissipation modes of chlorophyll excitation. By measuring fluorescence, therefore, NPQ and photochemical quenching can also be metered. Additionally, high-light saturating light pulses lead to a 'closing' of PSII reaction centers where the electron donation to the following electron acceptor plastoquinone is much slower than the rate of incoming, exciting photons. This output limitation leads to a buildup of electrons inside the photosystem and, ultimately, a blockage of photochemical quenching. Therefore, quantifying the fluorescence of closed photosystems allows for inferring non-photochemical quenching."

msgstr "However, the fluorescence intensity is also proportional to the intensity of the incoming light. Therefore, the signal must be normalized to obtain the fraction of incoming energy dissipated as fluorescence, deemed the fluorescence yield. Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM, illustrated below) is one method to quantify this yield. PAM allows fluorescence yield measurements over time and under changing light conditions (dark, light, saturating, and others). Photosynthetic parameters like the photosynthetic efficiency 'ΦPSII' and NPQ can be quantified by relating measurements within a PAM protocol and observing the fluorescence dynamics."

msgid "MTH_EXPLANATION_INTRODUCTION_ATTEMPTS"
msgstr "PAM employs a series of high-frequency light pulses with weak constant intensity, the measuring light (ML), to quantify the fluorescence yield. The pulses are too weak to induce significant photosynthetic activity but induce measurable fluorescence. As the exact timing of these measuring pulses is known, signal amplification through a lock-in amplifier selectively measures the fluorescence response to the constant-intensity pulses, which is proportional to the fluorescence yield (Schreiber, 2004).\n\nThe following figure visualizes the explained principles. The fluorescence yield measured throughout a typical PAM experiment can be seen in the bottom panel. The protocol involves a dark-adapted plant being exposed to weak constant ('actinic') light (AL, white area shown in the light bar, L), followed by dark recovery, where the light is switched off completely (black area in L). Multiple saturating light flashes (saturation pulses, SP) are applied before, during, and after the actinic illumination to measure the maximal fluorescence Fm, Fm', Fm'', respectively. These fluorescence features are used in the quantification of fluorescence parameters.\nThe upper half of the figure explains in more detail the fluorescence behavior of chlorophyll: Light energy absorption brings chlorophyll molecules to the first excited state (S1, see the simplified Jablonsky diagram in the upper panel on the left). For chlorophylls to return to the ground state (S0), the absorbed energy can be used for charge separation and photosynthesis (photochemical quenching, qP), dissipated as heat (non-photochemical quenching, NPQ), or re-emitted as fluorescence. The fluorescence emission spectra are red-shifted from the absorption spectra (upper panel on the right). Therefore, the fluorescence can be detected using fluorometers with corresponding optical filters, and their signal will not be mistaken for the irradiant light. The emitted fluorescence signal is recorded with key readouts, as the lower panel shows. This summary figure is reproduced from Nies et al. (2021)."

In this state, the measuring light is fully converted into fluorescence, and we measure the maximal fluorescence yield 'Fm'. While the standard fluorescence yield depends on the plant's photosynthesis, the Fm does not. So by comparing normal and maximal yield, we can tell apart changes in and outside photosynthesis, for example, the plant's light protection. When you also apply protocols of differently colored lights, you can calculate the previously mentioned ΦPSII, NPQ, and many other values. But how that is done goes much too far. Most important is that you understand that we compare what fraction of light is currently turned to fluorescence, how much at maximum, and how these measurements change over time and conditions."

This translation is yet to be one-to-one and imposes a certain level of **simplification**. Therefore, models are never a precise description, including all levels of details, but a simplification created with rigid methods for a specific study. The problem described using mathematical terms is then solved using mathematical techniques, today enormously aided with **computational** programs. The resulting solution is then applied to the real-world problem and evaluated. If additional solutions are required, the mathematical model must be revised.

This disease has surprised the people of Planet-X so that they separated their population into three categories: the ones that are susceptible to the disease and can get sick at any moment (S), the ones that recovered from the infection (R), and the currently infected ones (I). To model the transition between each category, we determine the rate of infection (v<sub>1</sub>) dependent on the number of S and I in the total population (N) and their rate of recovery (v<sub>2</sub>) solely reliant on the I. They also discovered that the R gain complete immunity, but the people are too stressed to grow their population. To know how their population will look in a few months, they try a new method they heard from Earth about, namely **mathematical modeling**. To start, you should create a scheme for your problem; in this case, the S will become I at a rate of v<sub>1</sub>, and the I will become R at a rate of v<sub>2</sub>. The rate v<sub>1</sub> is dependent on the infection rate of the disease (β), the number of S and I in relation to the N.

Using differential equations, you can describe the relationship between the time and the change in the number of people in each category, so overall, there are three equations.

By using integration, one can calculate the amount of each compound at any given time and depict the change over time when doing so for multiple time points. Let's apply this method to the disease on Planet-X. According to the scientists, the infection rate is (β&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), and the recovery rate is (γ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.2). With these values and starting populations of (S&nbsp;=&nbsp;900), (I&nbsp;=&nbsp;100), (R&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), and (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;S&nbsp;+&nbsp;I&nbsp;+&nbsp;R&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000), we can solve our ODE system. The resulting graph shows that the disease on Planet-X will eventually be irradicated on its own. Here we also gave you the possibility to use an interactive version of the Model."

It was first created in 1980 by Graham Farquhar, Susanne von Caemmerer, and Joseph Berry and has since undergone many different variations and updates. The most basic version uses four equations, each depicting the A with a specific limiting rate. These include the RuBisCO limited rate (A<sub>c</sub>), the electron transport limited rate (A<sub>j</sub>), and the triphosphate limited rate (A<sub>p</sub>), where the minimum of the three is taken as the end-resulting A. These equations include several different parameters that can be measured or estimated beforehand.

As you may have guessed, this model type differs from the SIR model we explained earlier. It doesn’t use any ODEs and, therefore, cannot show the change in time. It only shows the A specific for the parameter values chosen. It thus depicts the plant photosynthesis in a steady state. This state is achievable for the plant systems themselves, but due to the many fluctuations of environmental conditions, it is never achieved in nature. This is why this model is not the most accurate representation of photosynthesis. However, it is still considered one of the best due to its simplicity."

To avoid being overwhelmed by the number of parameters you can vary, we have set default values for the other essential parameters by following the data given by the 2013 review of this model by von Caemmerer.

Since photosynthesis is a convoluted mechanism, this model strives to include most components while simplifying where necessary. It builds upon previous works by Zhu et al., incorporating the reactions associated with light absorption, excitation energy transfer, charge separation, and electron transfer around PSII from their fluorescence induction model. Additionally, it introduces analogous reactions for PSI and includes reactions from their carbon metabolism model, such as those involved in the C<sub>3</sub> cycle, sucrose and starch synthesis, and photorespiration. The model further accounts for ion transfer between the lumen and stroma, ATP and NADPH synthesis, RuBisCO activation by RuBisCO activase, NPQ by luminal pH and the xanthophyll cycle, and regulation of enzyme activities by the ferredoxin (Fd) thioredoxin system.\n"
"\n Even though this model is very complex, it still introduces some simplifications; for example, the steps between the electron transfer of the chlorophyll *a* molecule and Fd are ignored. Furthermore, to calculate the A, this model uses the rate of carboxylation (V<sub>c</sub>) and the rate of glycine decarboxylase (v<sub>131</sub>).

During the day, they close their stomata to prevent water loss through transpiration and release the CO2 from the malate into the chloroplasts to be used in the Calvin Cycle, similar to C<sub>3</sub> plants.

msgstr "Since you have found out how plants react to different light intensities, we have news for you! Plants can be actually *trained* to enhance their photoprotection. It has been observed experimentally that plants previously exposed to light react differently to light than those exposed to light for the first time! This phenomenon is sometimes called **short-term light memory**, and we know now which molecular mechanism causes this effect. We have used this knowledge to represent the behavior with a mathematical model. Now, you can perform your own **memory experiments**. Go ahead; you can simulate different scenarios using the seven sliders below. Do you see how the fluorescence signal differs between different experiment phases? By changing the conversion rates to Zeaxanthin and Violaxanthin, you are also able to play around with a mutated version of the plant, where you can change the memory of the plant."

msgstr "We hope you have received a thorough introduction to the captivating realm of (computational) plant biology through this website. By examining diagrams made with computer models, you have gained knowledge about the impact of light intensity on photosynthesis and delved into the subject of plant short-term memory. We hope we could show you the following:\n"
"- Light intensity significantly affects the rate of photosynthesis in plants. As light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases to some degree.\n"
"- The relationship between light intensity and photosynthetic rate is not linear. Rather, it follows a curve that peaks at a certain saturation point, like in the figure below."

msgstr "- Plants can recall previous exposure to light and adjust their photosynthetic rates accordingly. This short-term memory enables them to absorb light energy and adapt to various environmental conditions efficiently.\n"
"- We believe that the measurement of PAM is an exciting and effective method to learn about the intricate mechanisms underlying plant growth and development.\n" 
"\n Finally, please consider these findings and their broader implications for our comprehension of the natural world. By doing so, you will be able to recognize and admire the remarkable intricacy and magnificence of the plant kingdom.\n\n Computational models exist for almost all scientific disciplines, and even considering only photosynthesis models, we have barely scratched the surface of what is out there. Hopefully, this small course has shown you how interesting and useful modeling can be. For a problem in the future, you will think, '*Could a model help me with this*?'.\n\n **But most of all, we hope you had fun with our course. If you want, give us feedback and tell others about your experience. Have a great day!**"
