msgstr "As plants **cannot run** away, they must adapt to their changed environmental conditions. Plants are the basis of \
        life on Earth (Fig. left), and plant adaptation is crucial for a functioning world. Varied conditions, like e.g., \
        changed temperatures (heat and cold), flooding events, and drought can lead to stressful events in plants. Those \
        factors can have various short- and long-term effects on plants– summarized in Fig. right. Nevertheless, plants \
        experience stress upon sudden changes but have a *highly flexible metabolism* for adaptation. *One of the first \
        reactions in plant metabolism is photosynthesis*, which **delivers energy** to sustain plant life. Photosynthesis \
        itself is directly and indirectly affected by changed environmental conditions. Therefore, the analysis of \
        photosynthesis and the fixation of CO₂ by plants is an important measure of overall **plant fitness**, **productivity**, \
        and **survival**. Consequently, basic research on photosynthesis and its efficiency is essential to assess our changing world."

On this page you will learn how can we measure the dynamics of photosynthesis in real time using light (precisely fluorescence) measuring devices. As biology is continously becoming a more quantitative science, obviously numerous methods to probe photosynthesis exist. For example, as plants produce oxygen and take up carbon dioxide, photosynthesis can be measured by how fast these gasses are produced or consumed. However, metering gasses can be tricky, especially if you want to do it outside on a tree or in a field. Therefore a particularly important characteristic of photosynthetic organisms is essential in providing alternative methods of measuring photosynthesis *in vivo*!"

When light shines on leaves, they use majority of the light to run complex photochemical reactions of photosynthesis, but a small part of the absorbed light is reemitted. Something similar happens when your white \
        T-shirt shines purple in a disco's black light. When something shine in a different light color when illuminated, \
        this is called 'fluorescence'. And the plant's fluorescence shine is red."

        Plants don't absorb green light and instead reflect it, which we see as their primary color. Their red shine, \
        however, is much fainter than that, and with stronger light coming into our eyes from all directions, we just can't see it."

        action. Because the plant cannot move, it must adjust to its surroundings. A lot of light arrived at the leaf's \
        parts not covered by the sticker. Because that light could be harmful, the plant quickly produced some chemicals \
        acting as a kind of sunscreen within the cells. After a few seconds, these cells were protected and received less \
        light and fluoresced less. But, when we lifted the sticker, the cells below had not produced sunscreen. They saw \
        the intense light and fluoresced at full force - right next to their protected neighbors. This sharp difference \
        in fluorescence you saw as the stickers after-image. And as we continued shining the lamp, all cells adapted to \
        it, vanishing the picture on the leaf."

        we might be interested in: How healthy the leaf is, how much it protects itself from the light, and, most \
        importantly, how it is doing photosynthesis. We name this last measurement 'ΦPSII', with the greek letter 'Psi', \
        and you might see it along some of the graphs you will produce later. The higher it is, the better, as the plant \
        is doing photosynthesis more efficiently."

msgstr "In this one figure the basic principles behind the fluorescence and PAM experiment are explained. \
In the bottom panel you see results of the PAM experiments. Take a good look, cause in few minutes you will be producing similar results but not with a help of a fluorometer but your computer! So what do we see in this graph? It is a result of a special light protocol, where a dark-adapted plant is exposed to very weak, actinic light (AL, white area shown in the light bar, L) followed by dark recovery, where the light is switched off completely (black area in L). Multiple saturating light flashes (saturation pulses, SP) are applied before, during and after the actinic illumination to measure the maximal fluorescence Fm, Fm', Fm'', respectively. So why do we exactly see any effect? This is explained with the upper left scheme. Light energy absorption brings chlorophyll molecules to the first excited state (S1, see the simplified Jablonsky diagram in the upper panel on the left). For chlorophylls to return to the ground state (S0), the absorbed energy can be used for charge separation and photosynthesis (photochemical quenching, qP), dissipated as heat (non-photochemical quenching, NPQ), or re-emitted as fluorescence. And now, the most important part: the fluorescence emission spectra are red-shifted from the absorption spectra (upper panel on the right). This basically means that the fluorescence can be detected using fluorometers with corresponding optical filters and their signal will not be mistaken with the light that we actually shine on the plants. The emitted fluorescence signal is recorded, as shown in the lower panel with key readouts. It took us a long time to summarize everything on one figure only and this figure originates from our previous work (Nies et al. 2021)."

It has been observed experimentally that plants previously exposed to light react differently to light in comparison to those exposed to light for the first time! This phenomenon is sometimes called **short-term light memory* and we know now which molecular mechanism causes this effect. We have used this knowledge to represent the behaviour with a mathematical model and now, you can perform your own **memory experiments**. Go ahead, can simulate different scenarios using the two sliders below. Do you see how the fluorescence signal differs between different phases of the experiment?

#: Conclusion
msgid "BEGIN_OF_CONCLUTION"
msgstr "We hope you had a comprehensive introduction to the fascinating world of plant biology on this website. By \
        analyzing diagrams created with computer models, you were able to learn about the effects of light intensity \
        on photosynthesis and explore the topic of plant short-term memory. In doing so, you should have drawn the \
        following conclusions:"

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_1"
msgstr "- Light intensity has a significant effect on the rate of photosynthesis in plants. As light intensity \
        increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases to some degree."

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_2"
msgstr "- The relationship between light intensity and photosynthetic rate is not linear. Rather, it follows a curve \
        that peaks at a certain point, the saturation point."

#: Conclusion
msgid "CONCLUTION_POINT_3"
msgstr "- Plants have the ability to remember past light exposure and adjust their photosynthetic rates accordingly. \
        This short-term memory allows plants to optimize their energy consumption and adapt to changing environmental conditions."

#: Conclusion
msgid "END_OF_CONCLUTION"
msgstr "All in all, PAM measurement is an interesting and effective way to learn about the complex mechanisms \
        underlying plant growth and development. We encourage you to think about these conclusions and the broader \
        implications of these findings for our understanding of the natural world. In doing so, you will come to \
        appreciate even more the incredible complexity and beauty of the plant kingdom."
