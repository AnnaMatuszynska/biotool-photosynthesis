#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "INTRODUCTION_MEASUREMENT"
msgstr "On the previous page, you learned about the importance of photosynthesis, how it works, and how we can use \
        modelling to learn more about it. But biologists don't just like knowledge. They also like numbers and measuring \
        things. So researchers invented many ways of determining how much a plant is doing photosynthesis. For example, \
        you heard that plants produce oxygen and take up carbon dioxide. Therefore, photosynthesis can be measured by \
        how fast these gasses are produced or consumed. However, metering gasses can be tricky, especially if you want \
        to do it outside on a tree or in a field. "

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "INTRODUCTION_GLOWING"
msgstr "Here is where a specialty of plants comes into play: They can glow! When light shines on them, they not only \
        photosynthesize, but also release a small part of that absorbed light. Something similar happens when your white \
        T-shirt shines purple in a disco's black light. When something glows in a different light color when illuminated, \
        this is called 'fluorescence'. And the plant's fluorescence glow is red."

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "PLANT_ARE_SHINING_RED"
msgstr "Now you might think: 'But plants are green, and I have never seen one fluoresce!'. And, of course, this is right. \
        Plants don't absorb green light and instead reflect it, which we see as their primary color. Their red glow, \
        however, is much fainter than that, and with stronger light coming into our eyes from all directions, we just can't see it."

msgid "INTRODUCTION_EXPERIMENT"
msgstr "We, therefore, prepared a small experiment for you: Here, we covered a small portion of a plant's leaf with a \
        sticker and will now shine a strong light on it. The camera's red filter helps us ignore distracting light and \
        focus on the red fluorescence. Now watch what happens:"

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "EXPLANATION_VIDEO"
msgstr "Did you see the red glow and the sticker's ghostly imprint on the leaf? You just saw the plant's adaptation in \
        action. Because the plant cannot move, it must adjust to its surroundings. A lot of light arrived at the leaf's \
        parts not covered by the sticker. Because that light could be harmful, the plant quickly produced some chemicals \
        acting as a kind of sunscreen within the cells. After a few seconds, these cells were protected and received less \
        light and fluoresced less. But, when we lifted the sticker, the cells below had not produced sunscreen. They saw \
        the intense light and fluoresced at full force - right next to their protected neighbors. This sharp difference \
        in fluorescence you saw as the stickers after-image. And as we continued shining the lamp, all cells adapted to \
        it, vanishing the picture on the leaf."

msgid "INTRODUCTION_PAM_MEASUREMENT"
msgstr "###### Here, we will tell you about an exciting experiment researchers use to measure photosynthesis. The basis \
        for this you have already heard of: Fluorescence. This experiment is called 'Pulse Amplitude Modulation', or 'PAM' \
        for short. From the name, you can already deduce that we, as experimenters, 'modulate' (control) the 'amplitude' \
        (intensity) of light flashes."

msgstr "Measuring Light and Fluoreszenz"

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid "EXPLANATION_INTRODUCTION_ATTEMPTS"
msgstr "Indeed, we shine a very tight series of short and weak light flashes on the plant, over a thousand each second! \
        With this flashing, we measure the plant performance and call it 'measuring light'. The measuring light is too \
        weak to be used for photosynthesis, but strong enough to get the plant to fluoresce. And, since we produce \
        fluorescence with each flash, the resulting signal is patterned (modulated), just like the measuring light."

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid   "EXPLANATION_MEASUREMENT_2"
msgstr  "This patterning is essential because we want to measure photosynthesis under natural conditions, outside and in \
        different irradiation when the plant already fluoresces. Typically, we would not be able to tell apart the \
        fluorescence produced by the outside and the measuring light. But, because our measuring light and its resulting \
        fluorescence are -modulated-, with some clever math, we can calculate how much fluorescence was caused by just \
        our measuring light. And because all the flashes were the same, we measured the fraction of light turned to \
        fluorescence - a fluorescence yield. This yield is what you will see in the model graphs. It decreases when the \
        plant's photosynthesis is more efficient, with more powerful light protection, and many more factors also affect \
        it. And it is comparable regardless of the outside light - a versatile measurement."

msgstr  "Saturating Pulses"

#: Explanation by Tobias
msgid   "EXPLANATION_ATTEMPTS"
msgstr  "You need to know one more aspect of PAM, the saturating pulses. Our machine gives the plant a very intense light \
        pulse every few seconds, overloading its photosynthetic machinery. In this state, the measuring light is fully \
        converted into fluorescence, and we measure the maximal fluorescence yield 'Fm'. While the standard fluorescence \
        yield depends on the plant's photosynthesis, the Fm does not. So by comparing normal and maximal yield, we can \
        tell apart changes in and outside of photosynthesis, for example, the plant's light protection. When you then \
        also apply protocols of differently colored lights, you can calculate the previously mentioned ϕPSII, NPQ, and \
        many other values. But how that is done goes much too far. Most important is that you understand that we compare \
        what fraction of light is currently turned to fluorescence, how much at maximum, and how these measurements change \
        over time and conditions."
