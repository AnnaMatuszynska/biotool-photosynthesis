        we exploit the fact that plants to which too much energy is supplied fluoresce."

msgid   "EXPLANATION_MEASUREMENT"
msgstr  "As a measurement method we use the PAM measurement (Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorescence measurement). \
            First, photochemical quenching must be excluded. For this purpose, the plant is irradiated with pulses of \
            light of high intensity. The measured fluorescence can be attributed to NPQ if at the starting point the \
            plant was dark-adapted. The change in fluorescence during light or dark adaptations can be measured."

msgid "EXPLANATION_ATTEMPTS"
msgstr "**The experiments simulate photosystem 2 in *Arabidopsis thaliana* plants with the following prerequisites:** \
        The plants are of the wild type (*Arabidopsis thaliana* ecotype Columbia 0: hereafter referred to as Arabidopsis). \
        These plants grew for three weeks in soil at 23°C and were grown on a cycle of 16h light and 8h night with 90-100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ \
        irradiation. To ensure that the photosystem was not preloaded, the plants were dark-adapted for 12h."

msgid   "EXPLANATION_ILLUSTRATION"
msgstr  "The experiments always start with an illumination phase, which is marked in blue in the figures (see Figure 1); \
            as already mentioned, this is a prerequisite for the PAM measurement. At this point, we can measure Fₘ."
