simple-en msgstr "As plants **cannot run** away, they must adapt to their changed environmental conditions. Plants are the basis of life on Earth (Fig. left), and plant adaptation is crucial for a functioning world. Varied conditions, like e.g., changed temperatures (heat and cold), flooding events, and drought can lead to stressful events in plants. Those factors can have various short- and long-term effects on plants– summarized in Fig. right. Nevertheless, plants experience stress upon sudden changes but have a *highly flexible metabolism* for adaptation. *One of the first reactions in plant metabolism is photosynthesis*, which **delivers energy** to sustain plant life. Photosynthesis itself is directly and indirectly affected by changed environmental conditions. Therefore, the analysis of photosynthesis and the fixation of CO₂ by plants is an important measure of overall **plant fitness**, **productivity**, and **survival**. Consequently, basic research on photosynthesis and its efficiency is essential to assess our changing world."
simple-de msgstr "Da Pflanzen **nicht** weglaufen können, müssen sie sich an die veränderten Umweltbedingungen anpassen. Pflanzen \
        sind die Grundlage des Lebens auf der Erde (Abb. links), und die Anpassung der Pflanzen ist entscheidend für eine \

        und Trockenheit, können bei Pflanzen zu Stress führen. Diese Faktoren können verschiedene kurz- und langfristige \
        Auswirkungen auf Pflanzen haben, die in Abb. rechts zusammengefasst sind. Dennoch empfinden Pflanzen bei plötzlichen \
        Veränderungen Stress, haben aber einen *hochflexiblen Stoffwechsel* zur Anpassung. *Eine der ersten Reaktionen im \
        pflanzlichen Stoffwechsel ist die Photosynthese*, die **Energie** für die Aufrechterhaltung des Pflanzenlebens \

msgid "INTRODUCTION_MEASUREMENT"
advanced-en msgstr "On the previous page, you learned about the importance of photosynthesis and how it works. But how do we know how **photosynthetically active** an organism is? On this page you will learn how can we measure the dynamics of photosynthesis in real time using light (precisely fluorescence) measuring devices. As biology is continously becoming a more quantitative science, obviously numerous methods to probe photosynthesis exist. For example, as plants produce oxygen and take up carbon dioxide, photosynthesis can be measured by how fast these gasses are produced or consumed. However, metering gasses can be tricky, especially if you want to do it outside on a tree or in a field. Therefore a particularly important characteristic of photosynthetic organisms is essential in providing alternative methods of measuring photosynthesis *in vivo*!"

Because the plant cannot move, it must adjust to its surroundings. A lot of light arrived at the leaf's parts not covered by the sticker.

advanced-en msgstr "In this one figure the basic principles behind the fluorescence and PAM experiment are explained. In the bottom panel you see results of the PAM experiments. Take a good look, cause in few minutes you will be producing similar results but not with a help of a fluorometer but your computer! So what do we see in this graph? It is a result of a special light protocol, where a dark-adapted plant is exposed to very weak, actinic light (AL, white area shown in the light bar, L) followed by dark recovery, where the light is switched off completely (black area in L). Multiple saturating light flashes (saturation pulses, SP) are applied before, during and after the actinic illumination to measure the maximal fluorescence Fm, Fm', Fm'', respectively. So why do we exactly see any effect? This is explained with the upper left scheme. Light energy absorption brings chlorophyll molecules to the first excited state (S1, see the simplified Jablonsky diagram in the upper panel on the left). For chlorophylls to return to the ground state (S0), the absorbed energy can be used for charge separation and photosynthesis (photochemical quenching, qP), dissipated as heat (non-photochemical quenching, NPQ), or re-emitted as fluorescence. And now, the most important part: the fluorescence emission spectra are red-shifted from the absorption spectra (upper panel on the right). This basically means that the fluorescence can be detected using fluorometers with corresponding optical filters and their signal will not be mistaken with the light that we actually shine on the plants. The emitted fluorescence signal is recorded, as shown in the lower panel with key readouts. It took us a long time to summarize everything on one figure only and this figure originates from our previous work (Nies et al. 2021)."

advanced-en msgstr "You need to know one more aspect of PAM, the saturating pulses. Our machine gives the plant a very intense light pulse every few seconds, overloading its photosynthetic machinery. In this state, the measuring light is fully converted into fluorescence, and we measure the maximal fluorescence yield 'Fm'. While the standard fluorescence yield depends on the plant's photosynthesis, the Fm does not. So by comparing normal and maximal yield, we can tell apart changes in and outside of photosynthesis, for example, the plant's light protection. When you then also apply protocols of differently colored lights, you can calculate the previously mentioned ϕPSII, NPQ, and many other values. But how that is done goes much too far. Most important is that you understand that we compare what fraction of light is currently turned to fluorescence, how much at maximum, and how these measurements change over time and conditions."

To do that, you have to see what information you want to gather from your model, which is, in this case, the change in the population depending on the time.

If you have never seen what an ODE looks like, click the box Ordinary Differential Equations. Using differential equations, you can describe the relationship between the time and change in the number of people in each category, so overall, three equations.

advanced-en msgstr "We hope you have received a thorough introduction to the captivating realm of plant biology through this website. By examining diagrams made with computer models, you have gained knowledge about the impact of light intensity on photosynthesis and delved into the subject of plant short-term memory. Consequently, you should have arrived at the following conclusions:\n"
"- Light intensity has a significant effect on the rate of photosynthesis in plants. As light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases to some degree.\n"
"- The relationship between light intensity and photosynthetic rate is not linear Rather, it follows a curve that peaks at a certain point, the saturation point.\n"
"- Plants can recall previous exposure to light and adjust their photosynthetic rates accordingly. This short-term memory enables them to consume energy and adapt to various environmental conditions efficiently.\n"
"\n We believe that the measurement of PAM is an exciting and effective method to learn about the intricate mechanisms underlying plant growth and development. Please consider these findings and their broader implications for our comprehension of the natural world. By doing so, you will be able to recognize and admire the remarkable intricacy and magnificence of the plant kingdom."

simple-en msgstr "We hope you have received a thorough introduction to the captivating realm of plant biology through this website. By examining diagrams made with computer models, you have gained knowledge about the impact of light intensity on photosynthesis and delved into the subject of plant short-term memory. Consequently, you should have arrived at the following conclusions:\n"
"- Light intensity has a significant effect on the rate of photosynthesis in plants. As light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases to some degree.\n"
"- The relationship between light intensity and photosynthetic rate is not linear Rather, it follows a curve that peaks at a certain point, the saturation point.\n"
"- Plants can recall previous exposure to light and adjust their photosynthetic rates accordingly. This short-term memory enables them to consume energy and adapt to various environmental conditions efficiently.\n"
"\n We believe that the measurement of PAM is an exciting and effective method to learn about the intricate mechanisms underlying plant growth and development. Please consider these findings and their broader implications for our comprehension of the natural world. By doing so, you will be able to recognize and admire the remarkable intricacy and magnificence of the plant kingdom."
